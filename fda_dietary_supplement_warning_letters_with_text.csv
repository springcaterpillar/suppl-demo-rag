RE: 701480
Dear Andy Garcia:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://naturistastore.com/ from Dec 2024 to February 2025, and has observed that your website offered the product “ADVANCE KING”1for sale in the United States. In addition, FDA has obtained a sample of your “ADVANCE KING” product. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “ADVANCE KING” product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “ADVANCE KING” product contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients dexamethasone, diclofenac, and methocarbamol. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions. Corticosteroid use can impair a person’s ability to fight infections and can cause high blood sugar levels, muscle injuries and psychiatric problems. When corticosteroids are taken for a prolonged period, or at high doses, they can suppress the adrenal gland. Abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms. In addition, the undeclared dexamethasone in “ADVANCE KING” may cause serious side effects when combined with other medications.
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines.
Diclofenac may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant that can cause sedation, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Methocarbamol can also impair mental and physical abilities to perform certain tasks, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.
Information on the label and/or labeling of your “ADVANCE KING” product demonstrates that this product is marketed as a dietary supplement.2However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988 and dexamethasone, under the trade name Hexadrol, as a new drug on December 21, 1960. Given that diclofenac and dexamethasone were not marketed as dietary supplements or as food before Voltaren and Hexadrol were approved, “ADVANCE KING,” which contains diclofenac and dexamethasone, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Moreover, we note regardless of whether your “ADVANCE KING” product is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement, it is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for, among other things, use as an arthritis treatment.
Unapproved New Drug
Your “ADVANCE KING” product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website and from the labeling that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to the following:
On your product label:
“Hierbas medicinales para CALMAR el DOLOR” (English translation: Herbal medicine to relieve pain)o “Ciática” (English translation: Sciatica)o “Ácido Urico” (English translation: Uric Acid)o “Osteoartritis” (English translation: Osteoarthritis)o “Arteriosclerosis” (English translation: Arteriosclerosis)o “Gota” (English translation: Gout)
On your product promotional labeling
“Advance King es un suplemento totalmente natural para todos, desde atletas competitivos hasta jubilados que disfrutan de sus años dorados. Nuestra fórmula natural, puede ayudar potencialmente a fortalecer tus huesos, reducir el dolor articular, la rigidez articular y el deterioro del cartílago.” (English translation: Advance King is a totally natural supplement for everyone, from competitive athletes to retired people enjoying their golden years. Our natural formula can potentially help to strength your bones, reduce your joint pain, joint rigidity, and cartilage damage.)
“Fortalece y recupera la MOVILIDAD y FLEXIBILIDAD de tus articulaciones” (English translation: Strengthen and regain the mobility and flexibility in your joints)
Your “ADVANCE KING” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for your “ADVANCE KING,” product. Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drug
Your “ADVANCE KING” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “ADVANCE KING” product does not declare that the product contains dexamethasone, diclofenac, and methocarbamol. As previously mentioned, these undeclared ingredients in your “ADVANCE KING” product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product labeling renders your “ADVANCE KING” product misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a).
We also documented that your website https://naturistastore.com/ offered for sale “NatuMex Artri Ajo King,”3“NatuMex Artri King,”4“Royal Honey Sachets,”5“CURCUFLEX,”6“UNAVY,”7“Rmary Hyaluronic Acid,”8“FOREVER FOREVER,”9and “Kukamonga Acido Hialuronico,”10to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA lab analyses of products similarly named to those sold on your website revealed these products contained undeclared drug ingredients. While the Agency has not sampled and tested these product variations from your inventory to date, this letter also expresses our serious concern about the safety of these products and emphasize that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that products you sell do not contain any undeclared or potentially harmful ingredients, and that they are marketed in compliance with applicable laws.
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAAdvisory@fda.hhs.gov. Please include your firm name and the unique identifier “CMS 701480” in the subject line of the email.

RE: 700591
Dear Joseph Young:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the internet address www.picoiv.com in January 2024 and has observed that your website offers “Pico IV,” an intravenous form of cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100094470687041 and www.instagram.com/picoivcbd/. Your social media websites direct consumers to your www.picoiv.com website to purchase your products. As described below, your “Pico IV” product is an unapproved new drug introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Your “Pico IV” product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because injectable drug products can pose risks of serious harm to users. Injectable products are delivered directly into the body and therefore bypass some of the body’s key defenses against toxins and microorganisms that can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions.
You appear to be marketing your “Pico IV” as a dietary supplement. For example, marketing material found on your website states that “CBD, and other cannabinoids, are considered dietary supplements by the FDA . . . even if they’re administered intravenously.” The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i), 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i), as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your “Pico IV” (or any intravenously administered product) is not intended for ingestion. For this reason, among others, your “Pico IV” product does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act. Based on our review of your social media websites and website (www.picoiv.com), your “Pico IV” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your social media websites and website (www.picoiv.com) that establish the intended use of “Pico IV” as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your social media websites at www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100094470687041 and www.instagram.com/picoivcbd/:
January 22, 2025 post: “PICO IV CBD IV’s may be a game-changer for active lifestyles. Intravenous delivery allows for rapid absorption, potentially aiding in faster muscle recover, reduced inflammation, and pain relief after intense workouts. CBD interacts with the body’s endocannabinoid system, influencing pain perception, inflammation, and mood. This may translate to improved sleep, reduced anxiety, and overall better recovery.”

Your webpage https://www.picoiv.com/testimonials contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of your product for the cure or treatment of disease and/or to affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of such testimonials include:
“I had a motorcycle accident about 6 months ago and shattered my foot. I have pins and plates in my heel and throughout my recovery process doing these infusions I have had less inflammation and less pain in my foot and with a high threshold of pain comes stress and the CBD has helped relieve some of that stress giving me better sleep. I also love the staff at PicoIV and my experience has been very positive.”
“I have learned to manage my emotions, but I still suffered from anxiety and was heavily reliant on benzodiazepines to control it. While reading numerous medical journals on the negative long-term effects of Xanax, I realized I had to stop the destructive cycle and search for another way to manage my anxiety . . . I have now completed two PICO CBD infusions (each 14 days apart) and have had no need to take any Xanax. It's been years since I have been able to go 30+ days without an anti-anxiety pill.”
Your “Pico IV” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 is in effect for your product. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of “Pico IV” violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).

RE: 693439
Dear Anakaren Lopez:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.productosnaturalesca.com from May 2024 to February 2025, and has observed that during this time your website offered the products “AK Forte,”1 “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” “RenaLimp,” “Miel de Abeja Para Limpiar tus Ojos,” and “Ojo Roja Para Limpiar tus Ojos” for sale in the United States. In addition, FDA has obtained a sample of your “AK Forte” product.
As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “AK Forte,” “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” and “RenaLimp” products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “AK Forte” product contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients acetaminophen and diclofenac. Acetaminophen is a drug used to reduce pain and fever that is found in many prescription and over-the-counter drug products. Use of the product “AK Forte” poses a serious threat to consumers because it may result in unintentional acetaminophen overdose, especially if it is used in combination with other acetaminophen-containing products. Acetaminophen overdose can cause liver damage (hepatoxicity), ranging in severity from abnormalities in liver function to acute liver failure, and even death. People who experience unintentional acetaminophen overdose may not seek prompt medical attention because the symptoms of liver damage can take several days to emerge, even in severe cases. Acetaminophen may also cause serious skin reactions. Symptoms may include skin reddening, rash, and blisters.
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. Diclofenac may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Information on the label and/or labeling of your “AK Forte” product demonstrates that this product is marketed as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Voltaren was approved, “AK Forte,” which contains diclofenac, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Moreover, we note regardless of whether your “AK Forte” product is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement, it is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for, among other things, use as an arthritis treatment.
We also note that your “Miel de Abeja Para Limpiar tus Ojos” and “Ojo Roja Para Limpiar tus Ojos” products are especially concerning from a public health perspective. Ophthalmic drug products, which are intended for administration into the eyes, in general pose a greater risk of harm to users because the route of administration for these products bypasses some of the body’s natural defenses.

Your “AK Forte,” “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” “RenaLimp,” “Miel de Abeja Para Limpiar tus Ojos,” and “Ojo Roja Para Limpiar tus Ojos” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). Because “AK Forte,” “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” “RenaLimp,” “Miel de Abeja Para Limpiar tus Ojos,” and “Ojo Roja Para Limpiar tus Ojos” are new drugs and there are no FDA-approved applications in effect for these products, these products are unapproved new drugs.
Introduction or delivery of these unapproved new drug products into interstate commerce violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “AK Forte” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “AK Forte” product does not declare that the product contains acetaminophen or diclofenac. As previously mentioned, these undeclared ingredients in your “AK Forte” product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product labeling renders your “AK Forte” product misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a).
Additionally, a drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1) if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” and “RenaLimp” products are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your “TE DE MORONEL,” “Jengibre en Polvo,” “Té Uva Ursi,” and “RenaLimp” products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
We also documented that your website https://productosnaturalesca.com offered for sale “Artri Ajo King,”2“Artri King,”3“Ortiga Mas Ajo,”4“RM Flex,”5Reumo Flex,”6and “Umary”7to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA lab analyses of products similarly named to those sold on your website revealed these products contained the undeclared drug ingredients. While the Agency has not sampled and tested these product variations from your inventory to date, this letter also expresses our serious concern about the safety of these products and emphasizes that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that products you sell do not contain any undeclared or potentially harmful ingredients, and that they are marketed in compliance with applicable laws.
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAAdvisory@fda.hhs.gov. Please include your firm name and the unique identifier “CMS 693439” in the subject line of the email.

WARNING LETTER
FDA Ref. No.: 25-HFD-45-02-01
Dear Mr. Oswald:
This Warning Letter informs you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted between June 26 and June 30, 2023. Investigator Rebecca T. Davis, representing FDA, reviewed the role of ISOThrive, Inc. (ISOThrive) as the sponsor of the following clinical investigations of the investigational drug(b)(4):
(b)(4)
(b)(4)
This inspection was conducted as a part of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to evaluate the conduct of research and to help ensure that the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects have been protected.
At the conclusion of the inspection, Investigator Davis presented and discussed with you the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your July 20, 2023, written response to the Form FDA 483.
From our review of the FDA Establishment Inspection Report, the documents submitted with that report, and your written response dated July 20, 2023, it appears that ISOThrive did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and applicable regulations contained in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 312 (21 CFR 312) governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects. We wish to emphasize the following:
You failed to submit an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for the conduct of clinical investigations with an investigational new drug that is subject to 21 CFR 312.2(a) [21 CFR 312.20(a), 312.20(b), and 312.40(a)].
FDA regulations require a sponsor to submit, and to have in effect, an IND before initiating a clinical investigation of a drug that is subject to 21 CFR 312.2(a) [see 21 CFR 312.20 and 312.40(a)] in human subjects, unless the clinical investigation qualifies for an IND exemption under 21 CFR 312.2. ISOThrive failed to comply with these requirements. Specifically, ISOThrive initiated and conducted the following clinical investigations of an investigational drug subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355] without submitting and having in effect an IND:
The clinical investigation of the investigational drug(b)(4)conducted under Protocol(b)(4)
The clinical investigation of the investigational drug(b)(4)conducted under Protocol(b)(4)
In your July 20, 2023, written response to the Form FDA 483, ISOThrive stated that after review of the FDA regulations and guidance1, it determined that Protocols(b)(4)and(b)(4)were IND-exempt for the following reasons: (1) The investigational drug,(b)(4), was and remains a commercially available dietary supplement; (2) the endpoint of both studies was tolerability of the product; and (3) neither of these studies was designed with an “intent-to-treat” a disease. Additionally, ISOThrive stated that in October 2022, an IND application was submitted to FDA once it was desired to study the investigational drug as a potential treatment option for a specific disease.
However, Protocols(b)(4)and(b)(4)do not qualify for any of the exemptions listed at 21 CFR 312.2 from the application of 21 CFR 312. To be IND-exempt under 21 CFR 312.2, the investigational product must be lawfully marketed in the United States as a drug product. As explained in your July 20, 2023, written response,(b)(4)is marketed as a dietary supplement, not as a drug product.
For the reasons described below, we conclude that the evidence collected during the inspection shows that(b)(4)was intended for use as a drug, not as a dietary supplement, in the two clinical investigations named above. Therefore, ISOThrive was required to submit an IND before conducting the clinical investigations.
Section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] defines adrugas “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals….” ISOThrive studied the effectiveness of(b)(4)for treating a disease, as described below:
Although Protocol(b)(4)identified the “efficacy endpoint” as an assessment of tolerability of(b)(4)in subjects with(b)(4), the “primary outcome measures” for Protocol(b)(4)included measurement of differences in baseline and post-intervention scores of(b)(4)(for example, symptoms of(b)(4)) on the(b)(4)ReQuest Short Version and(b)(4)ReQuest Long Version questionnaires in subjects with(b)(4). These instruments are used to assess(b)(4), including symptoms of(b)(4). Therefore, Protocol(b)(4)collected study data to assess the effect of(b)(4)on(b)(4), as measured by(b)(4).
Although Protocol(b)(4)identified the ”efficacy endpoint” as an assessment of tolerability of(b)(4)in subjects with(b)(4), the “primary outcome measures” for Protocol(b)(4)included differences in baseline and post-intervention scores on various questionnaires that are used to assess symptoms of(b)(4), including changes in bowel movement frequency and quality, in subjects with(b)(4). Therefore, Protocol(b)(4)collected study data to assess the effect of(b)(4)on(b)(4), as measured by(b)(4).
Whether an investigational article is a drug or a dietary supplement depends on the intent of the investigation. Based on the study designs of Protocols(b)(4)and(b)(4), the investigational product,(b)(4), as used in these clinical investigations, was a drug as defined in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act because(b)(4)was studied for use in the treatment of(b)(4)and for use In the treatment of(b)(4), respectively.
Thus, before initiating the clinical investigations of(b)(4)conducted under Protocols(b)(4)and(b)(4), under 21 CFR 312.40 ISOThrive was required to submit an IND to FDA and to have an IND in effect. FDA’s records indicate that ISOThrive failed to submit an IND before conducting Protocol(b)(4), in which 176 human subjects were enrolled and received study drug between July 15, 2020, and July 10, 2021; and before conducting Protocol(b)(4), in which 112 human subjects were enrolled and received study drug between November 17, 2020, and March 5, 2021.
We acknowledge your statements in your written response that you would “enhance [your] procedures for determining when an IND is required, thus allowing [your] future decisions to more closely align with the agency’s requirements and expectations.” However, your written response to the Form FDA 483 did not provide sufficient details of ISOThrive’s corrective action plan for developing and implementing procedures to comply with IND regulations, moving forward. As a result, ISOThrive’s response is inadequate. Without this information, we are unable to determine whether ISOThrive will comply with IND regulations in the future.
As a sponsor, you are responsible for ISOThrive’s compliance with IND requirements, including submitting and having in effect an IND before initiating a clinical investigation, and it is your responsibility to be aware of and to follow all applicable FDA regulations. ISOThrive’s failure to submit, and to have in effect, an IND before initiating clinical investigations with an investigational drug raises significant concerns regarding the safety and welfare of enrolled subjects, and raises concerns about the validity and integrity of data collected during the conduct of these clinical investigations.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deficiencies with your clinical studies of an investigational drug. It is your responsibility to ensure adherence to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. You should address any deficiencies and establish procedures to ensure that any ongoing or future studies comply with FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address the deficiencies noted above. Within 15 business days of your receipt of this letter, you should notify this office in writing of the actions you have taken to prevent similar violations in the future. Failure to address this matter adequately may lead to regulatory action. If you believe you have complied with the FD&C Act and relevant regulations, please include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this letter or the inspection, please email FDA at CDER-OSI-Communications@fda.hhs.gov. Your written response and any pertinent documentation should be addressed to:

RE: 698165
Dear Michael Lee:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://vitalityvita.com from August to December 2024 and your product listings on your Amazon storefronts at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CXTX9X8R/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2QN00MS00FLEE&psc=1 and https://www.amazon.com/ZoomMax-Nutrition-Maximize-Stamina-Vigorous/dp/B0D4SDCGZM/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6CSIXY89VWyHbQ%E2%80%A6 in October 2024. The FDA has observed that your website and your Amazon storefronts offer the products “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” for sale in the United States. In addition, FDA has obtained samples of your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that samples of your “VitalityXtra,”1“PeakMax,”2“ZapMax,”3and “ZoomMax,”4purchased from your before-noted websites, contain undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) sildenafil. Additionally, laboratory analyses identified the presence of undeclared API diclofenac in your “PeakMax,” “ZapMax, and “ZoomMax” products.
Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared API may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates.
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (commonly referred to as NSAIDs). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. This hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Information on the labels and/or labeling of your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” demonstrate that the products are marketed as dietary supplements.5Under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), if an article is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.
FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active pharmaceutical ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Given that sildenafil and diclofenac were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra or Voltaren were FDA-approved, “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax,” which contain sildenafil or sildenafil and diclofenac, are excluded from the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims from the labeling that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
VitalityXtraFrom the product label:• “Strength”• “Stamina”• “Endurance”
From your product webpage https://www.vitalityvita.com/products/vitalityxtra-male-supplement-for-endurance-vitality-energy-stamina-and-strength-fast-acting-physical-performance-10-count-per-pack:• “VitalityXtra, Male Supplement for Endurance, Vitality, Energy, Stamina, and Strength”• “Boost your energy for higher vitality.”• “[I]ncrease your endurance, and enhance your over health.”• “Greater endurance and stamina”
PeakMaxFrom your product webpage https://www.vitalityvita.com/products/peak-max-male-supplement-for-endurance-vitality-energy-10-count-per-pack?variant=45112925454499:• “Male Supplement for Endurance, Vitality, Energy”• “Are you looking to boost your vitality, endurance, drive, and stamina when you need it the most? Well, look no further! Our amazing blue pill supplement is here to help.”
ZapMaxFrom your product listing at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CXTX9X8R/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A2QN00MS00FLEE&psc=1• “[F]or Energy and Endurance”
ZoomMaxFrom your product listing at https://www.amazon.com/ZoomMax-Nutrition-Maximize-Stamina-Vigorous/dp/B0D4SDCGZM/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.6CSIXY89VWyHbQ%E2%80%A6• “Our natural herbal blend helps maximize demands for sports and other physical activity. Our natural ingredients helps [sic] your body improve its endurance and stamina to perform longer at your peak performance. It also improves your energy by raising your body's vigor and energy. Lastly, feel the improved physical strength.”
“VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No FDA-approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 are in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violate sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Misbranded Drug
Your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products do not declare that the products contain a PDE-5 inhibitor or diclofenac. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product labeling renders your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax” and “ZoomMax” products misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a).
Your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products, which contain undeclared sildenafil, are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), and as such, can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products such that a layperson can use the drugs safely for their intended uses. “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bears adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there are no FDA approved applications in effect for these products. For these reasons, your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your products also causes these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes your “VitalityXtra,” “PeakMax,” “ZapMax,” and “ZoomMax” products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

CMS #679737
Dear Mr. Jernigan:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 4825 Nome Street, Denver, CO, from January 29 through February 21, 2024. Based on inspectional findings, we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on February 21, 2024, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We acknowledge receipt of your responses dated February 22 and 23, March 12, 26, and 29, and April 4 and 8, 2024, and we address your responses below.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on January 29 through February 21, 2024, identified serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish component specifications for each component that you used in the manufacture of your Acetyl-glutathione dietary supplement product, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b).
• You failed to establish an identity specification, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Specifically, in your February 22, 2024, response, you provided a Certificate of Analysis (CoA) for the component silica mineral hydride complex from your supplier HWH World. The methods listed on the CoA do not provide the specificity necessary for proper identification of this dietary ingredient. Furthermore, you provided CoAs from your suppliers for the silica mineral hydride complex component and the magnesium ascorbate component; however, it is unclear whether these specifications are intended to suffice as your firm’s specifications and if they have been approved by your firm’s quality control personnel.• You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, you provided a CoA for your silica mineral hydride complex component from your supplier HWH World that is lacking strength specifications. Your finished product labeling for your Acetyl-glutathione product lists this component as being composed of enhanced silica with potassium carbonate, potassium citrate hydroxide, and magnesium sulfate.• You failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement for your Acetyl-glutathione component, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Specifically, you did not provide any heavy metal or microbial test specifications for your Acetyl-glutathione component.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, you have not established written procedures for quality control operations. This violation was not addressed in any of your responses to Form FDA 483.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). The MMRs must include the required elements of 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMR you provided in your April 8, 2024, response, which you call an “(b)(4)” or “(b)(4),” is not specific to a unique formulation of a dietary supplement and is not specific to batch size.
4. Your batch production records failed to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your batch production records failed to include:
• A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing (21 CFR 111.260(f));• The actual results obtained during any monitoring operation (21 CFR 111.260(g));• The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results (21 CFR 111.260(h));• Documentation, at the date and time of performance, of labeling operations (21 CFR 111.260(k));• An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label used in production (21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)).
These violations were not addressed in any of your responses to Form FDA 483.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for returned dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.503. Specifically, your SOP for returned dietary supplements does not include all required information. Your response dated April 8, 2024, includes a document titled Returned Product Procedure. However, the procedure does not address the requirement for quality control to conduct a material review and make a disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.510. The procedure states that the food safety officer will perform these activities. Furthermore, the procedure also does not address the requirement that if the reason for a dietary supplement being returned implicates other batches, you must conduct an investigation of the manufacturing processes and each of those other batches to determine compliance with specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.530.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition to the above-mentioned violations, we also have the following comment:
1. Your current finished product specification sheet for your Acetyl-glutathione product lists the test method as N/A. Please update this document to include the UPLC test method that is used to test the identity, purity, and strength of the finished product.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be addressed to Rebecca Allen, Compliance Officer, United States Food and Drug Administration, Human Foods Program, Office of Enforcement, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835 or via email at HFP-OCE-DietarySupplements@fda.hhs.gov.

Ref: CMS Case #681214
Dear Mr. Leonard:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 99 Federal Rd., Danbury, CT from January 26, 2024 to February 12, 2024. Based on inspectional findings and review of the product labels collected during the inspection, we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.
On January 23, 2024, after being notified of a consumer complaint received by the FDA regarding an anaphylactic death associated with Stew Leonard’s brand Florentine Cookies, your firm recalled the cookies. The products contained peanuts and eggs but your printed label on the package did not contain an allergen statement or ingredient declaration for peanuts or eggs.
1. Your Florentine Cookies products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)], in that the finished product labels fail to declare the major food allergens, peanuts and egg, as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act. Specifically, your Florentine Cookies products are manufactured for you using peanuts and eggs as ingredients, but these ingredients are not listed on the finished product label.
Section 201(qq) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(qq)], defines milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with the exception of highly refined oils, as “major food allergens.” A food is misbranded under section 403(w) of the Act if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or adjacent to the list of ingredients, section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived (e.g., “Whey (Milk)”), except the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen), section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
2. Your Florentine Cookies and Rainbow Cookies products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the products are fabricated from two or more ingredients, and the common or usual name of each ingredient is not declared on the label, as required under 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically,
The Florentine Cookies product is manufactured with the following ingredients that are not declared on your finished product label: peanuts, eggs, margarine (and its sub-ingredients), citric acid, mixed tocopherols, and palm kernel oil.
The Rainbow Cookies product is manufactured with the following ingredients that are not declared on your finished product label: Rice Flour, Apricot Kernels, Raspberries, Baking Powder (Sodium Acid Pyrophosphate, Baking Soda, Corn Starch, Monocalcium Phosphate), Wheat Gluten, Potassium Sorbate Preservative, Calcium Citrate, Fruit Juice Color, Vegetable Juice Color, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, Calcium Chloride, Carnauba Wax, and Xanthan Gum. Further, we note that your finished product label does not appear to have been updated after changing cookie suppliers.
According to 21 CFR 101.4(b)(2), the requirement to list these component ingredients (or “sub-ingredients”) may be met by either parenthetically listing the component ingredients after the common or usual name of the main ingredient [21 CFR 101.4(b)(2)(i)], or by listing the component ingredients without listing the ingredient itself [21 CFR 101.4(b)(2)(ii)]. Under the first alternative, the component ingredients must be listed in descending order of predominance within the multi-component ingredient; and under the second alternative, the component ingredients must be listed in descending order of predominance in the finished food.
3. Your Rainbow Cookies product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] because the Nutrition Facts label (NFL) is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9. Specifically, the NFL is not in the correct format. For example:a. The calorie declaration is not shown bolded and in larger print size, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(d)(1)(iii).b. It lacks the declaration for added sugars, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)c. It lacks the declaration for the required vitamins and minerals, vitamin D and potassium, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(ii)d. The footnote is not as required by 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your facility complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, or injunction.
We also have the following comment:
Your Florentine Cookies product lists “Sodium Benzoate” and “Soy Nuts” as ingredients which are not present on the ingredient list of the bulk cookies you receive. We note that your product label must accurately reflect the ingredients used to make this cookie. If the sodium benzoate ingredient performs a preservative function in this product, the function of the preservative must be declared to be in compliance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).
Please notify FDA in writing within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as providing copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration via email to HFP-OCE-Labeling@fda.hhs.gov. If sending a response by mail, address to Food and Drug Administration Human Foods Program – Office of Compliance and Enforcement, Office of Enforcement – Division of Critical Foods and Dietary Supplement Enforcement HFS-608, 5001 Campus Drive, College Park, MD 20740.If you have any questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact HFP-OCE-Labeling@fda.hhs.gov and include reference #681214 on any submissions and within the subject line of any email correspondence to the agency.

Based on inspectional findings and review of the product labels collected during the inspection we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on October 20, 2023, you were provided with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483).  We acknowledge receipt of your correspondence received on November 10, 2023, and we address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on October 12-13, 16, 18, and 20, identified serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the dietary supplements Grandma’s Herbs Kidney and(b)(4)manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)], because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirement area as follows:
1. You did not follow written procedures for quality control operations as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, you do not follow SOP0301-1,Quality Control Responsibilities, (effective date 04/05/2019):
The Master Manufacturing Records (MMRs) for(b)(4)do not reflect that they approved by your Quality Unit as required by your SOP 0301-0, section 4.1.5.
The Batch Production Records (BPRs) records for(b)(4)were not approved by the Quality Unit as required by your SOP0301-0, section 4.1.6. In addition, the batch records for(b)(4)were not reviewed and released by your Quality Unit.
You did not conduct periodic Good Manufacturing (GMP) internal audits of the entire plant with documented corrective actions, as required by your SOP 0301-0, section 4.1.13. An internal audit has not been conducted since 2022.
The calibration logs for scales located in the(b)(4)and(b)(4)rooms were not reviewed by your Quality Unit as required by your SOP 03010, section 4.1.14.
The Quality Unit did not review all laboratory control process and testing results, as required by your SOP 0301-0, section 4.1.16. The finished product testing results for(b)(4), and Grandma’s Herbs Kidney, lot 220107 both analyzed by(b)(4), were not reviewed by your Quality Unit prior to shipment into interstate  commerce.
We have reviewed your response dated November 10, 2023. In your response you state you will retrain your personnel and provide training records to FDA within 30 days. You did not provide any documentation; therefore, we cannot evaluate the implementation.
2. You failed to establish required specifications:
You did not establish an identity specification for each component as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Specifically, your documents intended to contain component specifications do not contain a specification target or range for “Identification” or indicate a Reference or Method to be used.(b)(4)(marshmallow) root powder, Juniper berry powder, and Yarrow herb/flower powder are components in Grandma’s Herbs Kidney.(b)(4)are components in(b)(4). None of these components have a listed specification target, range, reference, or test method. In addition, when asked for component specifications for juniper berry and buchu powder used in Grandma’s Herb Kidney, you stated you did not have any.
You did not establish component specifications for purity and strength as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, your documents intended to contain component specifications do not include target or range for purity or strength.(b)(4)(marshmallow) root powder, Juniper berry powder, and Yarrow herb/flower powder are components in Grandma’s Herbs Kidney.(b)(4)are components in(b)(4). None of these components have specifications for purity or strength.
We have reviewed your response dated November 10, 2023. In your response you state you will create specifications for raw materials and that you estimate it will take approximately 90 days. You did not provide any documentation of your specifications, so we cannot evaluate the implementation.
3. You did not establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of each dietary supplement you manufacture, as required by 21 CFR 111.70 (e). Specifically, when asked by the FDA investigator, you stated you do not have any finished product specifications for you Grandma’s Herbs Kidney, and(b)(4)dietary supplement that you manufacture.
We have reviewed your response dated November 10, 2023. In your response you state you will establish specifications for component purity and strengthen within 90 days. You did not provide any documentation, so we cannot evaluate the implementation.
4. You failed to establish MMRs for your products that include all elements required by 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMR for your products Grandma’s Herbs Kidney and(b)(4)failed to include the information required by 21 CFR 111.210, such as:
A statement of maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(f).
Your MMR did not include a description of packaging and a representative   label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g). Specifically, the MMRs for Grandma’s Herbs Kidney, and(b)(4)did not include an actual or representative label attached to the MMR or provide a physical location of the actual or representative label.
Written instructions including specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3). Specifically, your MMR for(b)(4)does not include instructions for capsule drying or packaging operations. In addition, the MMR does not contain detailed instructions for the encapsulation process.
We have reviewed your response dated November 10, 2023. In your response you state you will revise your MMRs and update FDA on your progress in 30 business days. You did not provide any documentation, so we cannot evaluate the implementation.
5. Your batch production record did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your batch records for Grandma’s Herbs Kidney and(b)(4)failed to include:

We have reviewed your response dated November 10, 2023. In your response you state you will update your batch production and update FDA on your progress in 30 business days. You did not provide any documentation, so we cannot evaluate the implementation.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed your products labels collected during the inspection and have determined the Grandma’s Herbs Kidney and(b)(4)products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C.  343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements.
Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The Grandma’s Herbs Kidney product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C.  § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). Specifically, you list the ingredients parsley, cleavers, and meadowsweet as “herb” and do not identify the plant part used in the product. If the whole or entire plant is used, that information must be listed.
2. The(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the labeling is false or misleading. The product label identifies the ingredient “candelilla wax”, but the batch record reviewed during the inspection for(b)(4), shows that candelilla wax was not added to the product despite the declaration on the label.
3. The Grandma’s Herbs Kidney and(b)(4)products are misbranded under 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] because the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of each product label does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:
- Grandma’s Herbs Kidney
i. The product label does not list the quantitative weight of the proprietary blend using the appropriate units, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).
ii. The dietary ingredients of the proprietary blend do not appear to be indented, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).
iii. The nutrition information is not presented using a uniform type size, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e). In addition, the heading “%Daily Value” fails to be bolded.
-(b)(4)
i. The product label does not have a heavy bar under the final (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(ii).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also have the following comment:
The Grandma’s Herbs Kidney product label declares “Allergy warning: Manufactured in facility that also handles milk, eggs, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, wheat and soybean.” Advisory labeling is not a substitute for adherence to current good manufacturing practices and, when used by a facility, food allergen preventive controls. See Guidance for Industry: Questions and Answers Regarding Food Allergens Labeling, (Edition 5) (https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidancedocuments/guidance-industry-questions-and-answers-regarding-food-allergenlabeling-edition-5). The firm should make every effort to ensure that they and their suppliers have adequate GMPs in place to prevent the unintentional inclusion of allergens in their products and ingredients.
Please notify this office in writing within 15 working days of the receipt of this letter of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent recurrence of the violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to identify violations and make corrections to ensure that similar violations will not recur. In your response, you should include documentation, including revised procedures. Photographic, results of tests you have conducted, and other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections.
Your written response should be sent to Director of Compliance Branch Jennifer Hicks at U.S. Food and Drug Administration, DFC Bldg 20 – W. 6th Ave & Kipling St., P.O. Box 25087, Denver, CO 80225. An emailed response is also acceptable. Files greater than 100 megabytes may be submitted as smaller files in separate emails. If you have questions regarding this letter, please contact Jennifer Hicks by telephone at (303) 503-9289 or by email at jennifer.hicks@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Martin:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, Far East Summit LLC, located at 38903 Dexter Road, Dexter, Oregon, from January 10, 2024, through February 14, 2024, during which FDA reviewed your product catalog, Far East Summit Product Listing and Order Form; and your website, www.fareastsummit.com. Based on our inspectional findings and our review of your product catalog and website, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
During the inspection, we reviewed your website, www.fareastsummit.com, from which you take orders for your products Si Ni San, Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang, Ba Zheng Tang, and Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang; and your product catalog, Far East Summit Product Listing and Order Form, which offers for sale your products Si Ni San, Bu Xue Tiao Jing Tang, Gan Mao Ling, Guan Jie, Huang Lian Shang Qing, Jin Gu Die Shang Wan, Shen Ling Bai Zhu San, Su Gan Wan, Tong Jing Tang, Xiao Jian Zhong Tang, and Xian Yao San. The claims on your website and product catalog establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of claims on your product catalog, Far East Summit Product Listing and Order Form, that provide evidence these products are intended for use as drugs include:
Si Ni San
“Expels pathogens, resolves depression”
Bu Xue Tiao Jing Tang
“[R]esolves depression”
Gan Mao Ling
“Relieves cough”
Xian Yao San
“[R]esolves depression”
Guan Jie
“Disperses swelling, disinhibits the joints and relieves . . . pain”
Huang Lian Shang Qing
“Suppresses cough”
Jin Gu Die Shang Wan
“Staunches bleeding, disperses swellings, and relieves pain”
Shen Ling Bai Zhu San
“Arrests diarrhea”
Su Gan Wan
“[R]esolves depression”
Tong Jing Tang
“Relieves pain”
Xiao Jian Zhong Tang
“Moderates pain”
Examples of claims on your website, www.fareastsummit.com, that provide evidence these products are intended for use as drugs include:
Si Ni San
“Expels pathogens, resolves depression”
Ba Zheng Tang
“Frees strangury”
Xue Fu Zhu Yu Tang
“Relieves pain”
Du Huo Ji Sheng Tang
“Relieves impediment pain.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Si Ni San, Bu Xue Tiao Jing Tang, Xian Yao San, and Su Gan Wan are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Si Ni San, Bu Xue Tiao Jing Tang, Xian Yao San, and Su Gan Wan products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
The inspection revealed significant violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish the following specifications required by 21 CFR 111.70:
An identity specification for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(b)(1)]. Specifically, you purport to confirm the identity of the(b)(4)dietary ingredients(b)(4), used to manufacture the dietary supplement products Emerald Energy Defense and Emerald Energy Original; the Eleuthero(b)(4)used to manufacture the dietary supplement product(b)(4); the(b)(4)used to manufacture the dietary supplement Sage Calm Spirit; the(b)(4)used to manufacture the dietary supplement(b)(4); and the(b)(4)used to manufacture the dietary supplement(b)(4)Awaken the Shen, by evaluating organoleptic properties (e.g., color, taste, smell, feel). However, all of the ingredients are(b)(4). Because many(b)(4)share the same organoleptic properties, analysis of organoleptic factors does not provide unique information that is specific to each of these ingredients and thus cannot confirm the identity of each ingredient.
Component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met [21 CFR 111.70(b)(2)]. For example, you have not established component specifications for the(b)(4)dietary ingredients(b)(4)that are necessary to ensure the specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of(b)(4)and(b)(4)manufactured using these ingredients are met.
Component specifications for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(b)(3)]. For example, you have not established limits for contaminants for(b)(4). Botanical dietary ingredients are frequently at risk for heavy metal, microbial, and pesticide contamination due to growing, harvesting, and processing factors.
Product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(e)]. Specifically, during the inspection you explained to the FDA Investigators that you did not currently have finished product specifications for the following dietary supplement products:(b)(4), Chinese Classics Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, Chinese Classics Er Chen Tang,(b)(4)Restore the Heart,(b)(4), and Herbalogic Quiet Mind. Furthermore, you provided copies of purported finished product specifications for the(b)(4)and(b)(4)dietary supplement products, which included physical and chemical parameters (appearance, odor, taste, % alcohol), heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic), and microbial standards [total plate count (TPC), Coliform,E. coli, yeast and mold,Salmonella, andStaphylococcus]. The physical and chemical factors do not constitute unique criteria that can confirm the identity of these products and do not evaluate the purity, strength, or composition of these finished products. There are other substances that share the same appearance, odor, taste, and percent alcohol criteria.
In addition to establishing these specifications, you must determine whether such specifications are met, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75.
2. You failed to investigate any product complaint that involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of 21 CFR part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury, as required under 21 CFR 111.560(a)(2). Specifically, during the process of reviewing your returns records, our Investigators found Returned Material Authorization (RMA) 88030, for which the reason for return was documented as “adverse event.” RMA 88030, initiated on March 30, 2022, recorded an adverse event involving hallucinations and mood alterations as the reason for return for one bottle of(b)(4). This bottle was subsequently discarded without further investigation to verify if the finished product or dietary ingredients used to manufacture the finished product met all required specifications.
3. You did not confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met by conducting appropriate tests or examinations or appropriately qualifying the supplier consistent with 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii), as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Specifically, you did not conduct appropriate tests or examinations or verify the results for pesticides, heavy metals, and as applicable, sulfites andStaphylococcus aureusin the supplier Certificate of Analysis (COA) for components used in the manufacture of(b)(4)Lot 883056 ((b)(4)) and Chinese Classics Er Chen Tang Lot 883513(b)(4).
4. You failed to use effective measures to protect against the inclusion of metal or other foreign material in components and dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.365(i). Specifically, during the inspection, the FDA Investigators observed gouges and scratches along the direct contact surfaces of the(b)(4)for the botanical material in your dietary supplements. The(b)(4)had visible areas where metal appeared to be missing. You do not have a method of preventing and detecting metal from being introduced into the components or dietary supplement products during processing using the(b)(4).
5. Your master manufacturing records (MMR) failed to include written instructions and specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement products and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1). Specifically, your MMRs for(b)(4)Mind Lot 883634,(b)(4)Restore the Heart Lot 884086,(b)(4)Lot 884158, and(b)(4)Lot 883970 are lacking key critical in-process specifications. For example, your MMRs do not include in-process specifications for cook times, oven temperatures for drying, kettle temperatures, temperature and processing time for dehydration step, and for particle size and other parameters to ensure homogeneity of the powdered material after milling, grinding, blending, and sifting steps before encapsulation.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
We reviewed product labeling on your website, www.fareastsummit.com, accessed through a practitioner account, and your product catalog, collected during the inspection, and have determined your Far East Summit Chinese Classics Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Er Chen Tang dietary supplement products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. In addition to being an unapproved new drug, your Ba Zheng Tang is also a misbranded dietary supplement because of the violations listed below. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Far East Summit Chinese Classics Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, Ba Zheng Tang, and Er Chen Tang dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.4 and 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
“Ba Zheng Tang”, “Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang”, and “Er Chen Tang” fail to declare the solvent used in the extract within the ingredient list.
“Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang” and “Er Chen Tang” list “Citrus” which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient.
2. Your Far East Summit Chinese Classics Ba Zheng Tang, Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang, and Er Chen Tang dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(s)(2)(A)(ii) and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example, your labels fail to present nutrition information on the nutrition label using the title, “Supplement Facts,” and your labels fail to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36.
3. Your Far East Summit Chinese Classics Ba Zheng Tang dietary supplement product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example, “herb” does not identify the plant part used in the product. If the whole or entire plant is used, that information must be listed.
4. Your Far East Summit Chinese Classics Bu Zhong Yi Qi Tang dietary supplement product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the product label makes structure/function claims that are not linked to the required FDA disclaimer, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b)-(e).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. Your firm includes “best by date” for the dietary supplement product bulk Chinese Classics Dianthus, FES Lot 883249. During the inspection, our Investigators observed that the bulk Chinese Classics Dianthus, FES Lot 883249, was originally encoded on the product label with “Lot 883249 Best By: 08/24.” Your firm printed new labels and you did not only change the lot number but also extended the product’s expiration date to “Lot 883249-1 Best By: 09/26.” You informed our Investigators that you did not conduct or have any data supporting the expiration dates listed on the product labels. Any expiration date you place on a product label should be supported by data that demonstrates the product’s shelf life [see 72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34856 (Jun. 25, 2007)].
2. You did not submit an update to your facility's registration within 60 calendar days of changes to the registration information previously submitted. As of September 12, 2024, your firm’s food facility registration listed your old address at 38880 Skeeter Bee Loop, and you have not submitted an update to your food facility registration to reflect the accurate address. Also, you have not updated your registration to indicate that you manufacture food for animal consumption.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021-4421, to the attention of Jinkee M. Vila-Binayug, Compliance Officer. Refer to Unique Identification Number CMS #681536 when replying.

WARNING LETTER
September 26, 2024
RE: 690510
Dear Christopher Ingram:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, https://www.hardsteelusa.com which redirects to https://supercoreintl.com/ from May to September 2024, where you take orders for “Hard Steel”1and “Gold Hard Steel Plus.”2In addition, FDA has obtained a sample and labeling of your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Hard Steel” product contains the undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients sildenafil and acetaminophen and your “Gold Hard Steel Plus” product contains undeclared sildenafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates. Acetaminophen is a medicine used to reduced pain and fever that is found in many prescriptions, and over-the-counter (OTC) drug products. Use of the product “Hard Steel” poses a serious threat to consumers because it may result in unintentional acetaminophen overdose, especially if it is used in combination with other acetaminophen-containing products. Acetaminophen overdose can cause liver damage (hepatoxicity), ranging in severity from abnormalities in liver function to acute liver failure, and even death. Victims of unintentional acetaminophen overdose may not seek prompt medical attention because the symptoms of liver damage can take several days to emerge, even in severe cases. Acetaminophen may also cause serious skin reactions. Symptoms may include skin reddening, rash, and blisters.
Information on the label and labeling of your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products demonstrate that these products are marketed as dietary supplements. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that sildenafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Viagra was approved, your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because they are intended to for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website and from the labeling, including the outer packaging, that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to the following:
Hard Steel
On your webpages https://hardsteelusa.com/hard-steel-20-count-capsules and https://supercoreintl.com/hard-steel-20-count-capsules/:
“Best Possible Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction”
“Hard Steel male enhancement is the most powerful all-natural treatment to combat erectile dysfunction.”
Gold Hard Steel Plus
On the product label:
“NO MORE Premature Ejaculation”
“Better Ejaculation Control, NO limits”
“Amazing Increase in Thickness”
“Maximize Length, Width and Stamina”
“Experience Rock Hard Erections”
On your webpages, https://hardsteelusa.com/hard-steel-gold-plus-liquid/ and https://supercoreintl.com/hard-steel-gold-plus-liquid/:
“Best Possible Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction, Extra Strength”
“Hard Steel wins against erectile dysfunction”
Your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for either of your “Hard Steel” or “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products. Introduction or delivery of either of these products into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).Misbranded Drugs
Your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products do not declare that the products contain a PDE-5 inhibitor or acetaminophen. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. As previously mentioned, the undeclared ingredients in your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product labeling renders your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
Your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products, which contain undeclared sildenafil, are prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), and as such, can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products such that a layperson can use the drug safely for its intended uses. “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bears adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there are no FDA approved applications in effect for these products. For these reasons, your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your products also causes these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because its labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes your “Hard Steel” and “Gold Hard Steel Plus” products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredient(s) and placed at risk for its associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
We also documented that your website, https://www.hardsteelusa.com, offers for sale variations of “Pink Pussycat”3and “HoneyGizer”4for sale to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA lab analyses of “Pink Pussycat” and “HoneyGizer” products similarly named to those sold on your websites revealed these products contained the undeclared ingredients sildenafil. While the Agency has not sampled and tested these product variations from your inventory to date, this letter is to express our serious concern about the safety of these products and emphasize that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that they do not contain any undeclared and potentially harmful ingredients.
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAAdvisory@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: CMS Case # 674740
Dear Mr. Perry:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1820 Industrial Circle, Unit B, Longmont, CO, from November 27 through December 12, 2023. Based on inspectional findings, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on December 12, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We received written responses from you dated January 3, April 12, April 25, May 9, and June 28, 2024, to the FDA 483. We address your responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on November 27 to December 12, 2023, identified serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the My GUT Shrooms Gummies 60 ct. and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsules 60 ct. dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish component specifications for each component that you use in the manufacturing of a dietary supplement as follows:
You failed to establish an identity specification for each component that you used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Specifically, you failed to establish an identity specification for every ingredient that includes a test method that will adequately identify the component.
We reviewed your firm’s January 3, 2024, April 12, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 9, 2024, and June 28, 2024, responses to the FDA 483. In your April 12, 2024, response, you provided component specifications for each component that you use to manufacture your My GUT Shrooms Gummy and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule finished products. However, we note that certain components (e.g., Organic Chaga Extract, Organic Maitake Extract, Organic Agaricus Blazei Extract, etc.) rely solely on the physical characteristics listed (e.g., color, smell, taste) for identification purposes. Organoleptic specifications are not appropriate to confirm the identity of each component in this case due to the physical similarities of certain components. For example, the specifications for Organic Maitake Extract and the Organic Agaricus Blazei Extract state that both are “yellow to brown” powders and the specification for the Organic Chaga Extract states that it is a “brown to black” powder, meaning that all three extracts may appear to be brown powders.
You failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Specifically, you failed to provide toxic element specifications for each of your mushroom components. Mushroom components, due to their common growing conditions, are at high risk for the accumulation of toxic elements.
We reviewed your firm’s January 3, 2024, April 12, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 9, 2024, and June 28, 2024, responses to the FDA 483. In your April 12, 2024, response, you provided component specifications for each component that you use to manufacture your My GUT Shrooms Gummy and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule finished products. We note that although all of your component specifications included microbial limits, you failed to provide toxic element specifications for each of your mushroom components.
For each specification that you are required to establish, you must take specific actions, after they are established, to verify that the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure that any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
2. You failed to, for each dietary supplement that you manufacture, establish product specifications for the identity of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, your My GUT Shrooms Gummy and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule finished dietary supplement products are lacking adequate identity and limits of contaminants specifications.
We reviewed your firm’s January 3, 2024, April 12, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 9, 2024, and June 28, 2024 responses to the FDA 483. In your April 25, 2024, and May 9, 2024 responses, you provided finished product specifications for your My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule and My GUT Shrooms Gummy finished dietary supplement products, respectively. Your finished product specifications rely on(b)(4). However,(b)(4)testing is not an adequate test method to identify your multi-component botanical finished products because of the number of ingredients in your finished products. More specifically, the overlying(b)(4)from all of the components will lead to overlapping component spectra that result in an indistinguishable finished product spectrum. Additionally, you provided specifications for the limits for microbial contaminants but failed to provide specifications for the limits for toxic elements for your finished products.
For each specification that you are required to establish, you must take specific actions, after they are established, to verify that the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure that any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
3. Your quality control personnel failed to ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Specifically, your MMR for My GUT Shrooms Gummies directs you to the components listed in the relevant batch production record (BPR), but the components listed in the BPR do not match the components listed on the dietary supplement product label. Your BPR for your product My GUT Shrooms Gummies 60 ct. lists the ingredients Sugar 1,(b)(4)and(b)(4)Color; however, the(b)(4)color ingredient is not listed on the label for this product, and the ingredients list on the label only lists one sugar ingredient.
4. You failed to prepare and follow a written MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a).
We reviewed your firm’s January 3, 2024, April 12, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 9, 2024, and June 28, 2024 responses to the FDA 483. Your responses do not adequately address the violation. Specifically, your MMRs for your My GUT Shrooms Gummy and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule finished products, which were provided in your April 12, 2024, response, are not specific to the batch size being manufactured, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a).
5. Your BPRs failed to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b). Specifically, your BPRs failed to include all of the required information under 21 CFR 111.260.
We reviewed your firm’s January 3, 2024, April 12, 2024, April 25, 2024, May 9, 2024, and June 28, 2024 responses to the FDA 483. In your April 12, 2024, response to the FDA 483, you provided revised, partially executed BPRs for your My GUT Shrooms Gummy and My IMMUNE Shrooms Capsule finished dietary supplement products. However, your BPRs failed to include actual or representative labels, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative labels, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(k)(2). For example, the label provided in your BPR for My GUT Shrooms Gummies is incomplete and lacking the Supplement Facts label and is therefore not representative of the full product label.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Attn: Kathy Tormey, Compliance Officer; 6th Ave and Kipling St, DFC Bldg. 20, PO Box 25087, Denver, Colorado, 80225-0087.

RE: 688046
Dear Mr. German Alegre:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.solovital.com/ in June 2024 and has observed that your website offers the product “Umary,” which is also referred to as “Umary Hyaluronic Acid” on your website, for sale in the United States. In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of your “Umary” product. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Umary” contains undeclared diclofenac and omeprazole.1Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (commonly referred to as NSAIDs). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. This hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (commonly referred to as PPI) used to treat gastric (stomach) acid-related disorders. PPI medicines may cause serious skin reactions, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and headache. This hidden ingredient may mask stomach issues such as erosions, ulcers, and stomach cancer, and it can also interact with other medications and should not be taken with certain medications.
Information on the label and/or labeling of “Umary” demonstrates that the product is marketed as a dietary supplement.2Under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), if an article is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.
FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Voltaren was approved, “Umary,” which contain diclofenac, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Umary” product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims from the labeling, including on your website https://www.solovital.com/, that provide evidence of the intended use of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Hyaluronic acid works as a cushion and lubricant in the joints and connective tissue. When joints are well lubricated they’re less likely to grind together. It has been known to reduce knee discomfort.""
“Umary” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No FDA-approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 are in effect for this product. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Misbranded Drug
Your “Umary” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “Umary” does not declare that the product contains the drug ingredients diclofenac and omeprazole. The failure to disclose the presence of diclofenac and omeprazole in the product’s labeling renders “Umary” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

RE: 682383
Dear Mr. Travis Bunch:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://alnaturaleshop.com/ in April 2024 and July 2024 and has observed that your website offers the product “Ossos-Sans” for sale in the United States. In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of your “Ossos-Sans” product. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Ossos-Sans” contains undeclared diclofenac and methocarbamol.1Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (commonly referred to as NSAIDs). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. This hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant that can cause sedation, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Methocarbamol can also impair mental and physical abilities to perform certain tasks, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.
Information on the label and/or labeling of “Ossos-Sans” demonstrates that the product is marketed as a dietary supplement.2Under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), if an article is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.
There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.
FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Voltaren was approved, “Ossos-Sans,” which contains diclofenac, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Ossos-Sans” product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims from the labeling, including the outer packaging, that provide evidence of the intended use of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Ossos-Sans”:• “Artritis” (English translation: Arthritis)• “Osteoporosis” (English translation: Osteoporosis)• “Osteoartritis” (English translation: Osteoarthritis)• “Fracturas” (English translation: Fractures)• “Inflamacion” (English translation: Inflammation)• “Reumos” (English translation: Rheumatisms)• “Golpes” (English translation: Bruises)• “Calambres” (English translation: Cramps)• “Regeneración de cartílago” (English translation: Cartilage Regeneration)• “Dolores Musculares” (English translation: Muscle Pains)
“Ossos-Sans” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Subject to certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). No FDA-approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355 are in effect for this product. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Misbranded Drug
Your “Ossos-Sans” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “Ossos-Sans” does not declare that the product contains the drug ingredients diclofenac and methocarbamol.

Dear Mr. Rivera:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 7232 Eckhert Rd., Ste 7234, San Antonio, TX 78238-1244 on October 25 – November 14, 2023. Based on inspectional findings, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on November 14, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We acknowledge receipt of your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024, and we address your responses below.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on October 25 through November 14, 2023 identified serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You did not retain reserve samples for the required time for use in appropriate investigations, as required by 21 CFR 111.465(b). Specifically, during the inspection, you told our investigator that you retain reserve samples of your repacked dietary supplement products for a period of(b)(4). Under 21 CFR 111.465(b), you must retain reserve samples for one year past the shelf-life date (if shelf-life dating is used), or for two years from the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with the reserve samples, for use in appropriate investigations.
We received and reviewed your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024. In your response to this observation, dated January 16, 2024, you stated that “[w]e corrected and labeled retention samples before the end of our inspection” and “[w]e have a special location for retention samples and hold for are [sic] required to hold for 2 years for the lot.” However, you did not provide any supporting documentation demonstrating you made these corrections. Further, the inspector did not observe any corrections prior to the closeout of the inspection. Consequently, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrections at this time.
2. You did not establish and follow written procedures for fulfilling the requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, Subpart G for product you receive for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.153. Specifically, during the inspection, you did not have any procedures in place for the dietary supplement products you receive for packaging and labeling, such as your THINK BOTANICALS IMMUNITY MUSHROOM gummy product. You repackage, label, and distribute the product, including Lot (L) 01-7314, distributed on 7/31/23.
We received and reviewed your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024. In your response to this observation, dated January 16, 2024, you stated that “[w]e updated the label to be in compliance.” On January 19, 2024, you provided a document titled “Inbound Policy.” To the extent you intend for this document to be your written procedures for fulfilling the requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, Subpart G, they do not. For example, your ""Inbound Policy"" failed to provide written procedures regarding the examination of each immediate container or grouping of immediate containers in a shipment of product that you receive for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement (and for distribution rather than for return to the supplier) for appropriate content label, container damage, or broken seals to determine whether the container condition may have resulted in contamination or deterioration of the received product, as required by 21 CFR 111.165(a).
3. You did not establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements related to your packaging and labeling operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.403. Specifically, during the inspection, our investigator requested these procedures, and you said that your company does not have any procedures in place for packaging and labeling operations for the dietary supplement products you receive for labeling, such as your THINK BOTANICALS IMMUNITY MUSHROOM gummy product. You repackage, label, and distribute the product, including Lot (L) 01-7314, distributed on 7/31/23.
We received and reviewed your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024. In your response to this observation, dated January 16, 2024, you provided a blank “PACKAGING DESIGN CHECKLIST (poly, carton)” and a “Pre-Operation Procedure.” In another response dated January 16, 2024, you also provided a “Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for GMP Clean Room: Repackaging of Bulk Products.” However, these documents do not cover all the applicable requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, Subpart L for written procedures for packaging and labeling operations. For example, none of these documents provide written procedures for the examination, before packaging and labeling operations, of packaging and labels for each batch of dietary supplement to determine whether the packaging and labels conform to the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111. 410(c). Likewise, none of these documents provide written procedures regarding the examination of a representative sample of each batch of repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements to determine whether the repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements meet all specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(g), as required by 21 CFR 111.420(b).
4. You did not establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements related to returned dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.503. Specifically, during the inspection, our investigator found that you do not have any procedures in place for the handling of returned dietary supplements, to include the identification and quarantine of the products until quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision.
We received and reviewed your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024. In your response to this observation, dated January 16, 2024, you stated “[t]his was a new product, and only a few samples of all products were released”; “[w]e are following the current process to control the release of new products”; and “[w]e have established a QA Hold program with a disposition for product.” You also provided a copy of your “QA Hold Procedure.” However, your “QA Hold Procedure” does not appear to cover returned dietary supplements. Rather, it applies to “nonconforming products and materials detected by Txsyn.” Accordingly, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrections at this time because you did not provide for review any written procedures for the receipt and disposition of a returned dietary supplements.
5. Your quality control personnel failed to approve the received product for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement before releasing the received product from quarantine, as required by 21 CFR 111.165(c)(3). Specifically, you received the dietary supplement THINK BOTANICALS IMMUNITY MUSHROOM gummy product from(b)(4)on(b)(4),(b)(4), under invoice number(b)(4). You repackaged, labeled, and released the product for distribution on 7/31/23 without approval by quality control personnel.
We received and reviewed your responses dated December 12, 2023, January 16, 2024, and January 19, 2024. In your response to this observation, dated January 16, 2024, you stated “[t]his was a new product; only a few samples were released.” You also provided an “Inbound Policy” and “Incoming Product Inspection” sheet, which appear to provide for quality control review prior to releasing dietary supplements from quarantine. We will assess the adequacy of your corrections during the next inspection.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

WARNING LETTER
June 12, 2024
WL 672954Dear Mr. Bailly:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 116 E. Alondra Blvd., Gardena, CA from October 3 through October 24, 2023. Based on the inspectional findings we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on October 24, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We acknowledge receipt of your written responses dated November 15, December 1, and December 7, 2023. Your November 15 and December 1, 2023, communications did not address the specific observations. We address your December 7, 2023, response below, where relevant.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility from October 3, 2023, through October 24, 2023, identified serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the Calcium Pyruvate, Chromium Picolinate, and CalComplex products manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You did not conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of a dietary ingredient, prior to its use, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), nor did you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) for exemption from such testing.Specifically, you did not conduct identity testing for(b)(4)Lot(b)(4), Naticol HPMG Lot(b)(4), and Aquamin F(b)(4)used in the manufacture of CalComplex Lot 523008; you did not conduct identity testing for(b)(4)Lot(b)(4)used in the manufacture of Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223; nor did you conduct identity testing for Calcium Pyruvate Lots(b)(4)or Lot(b)(4)used in the manufacture of Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822. You also have not petitioned the agency for an exemption for such testing.
We have reviewed your response dated December 7 ,2023, in which you provided revised raw material specifications for Aquamin F, Calcium Pyruvate,(b)(4), and Naticol HPMG. Each of these documents purports to establish a specification of more than(b)(4)match by FTIR. However, you did not provide test records to support that you are conducting identity testing in accordance with the established identity specifications for each of these components.
2. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically:
a. For(b)(4)you do not have specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of the(b)(4)and(b)(4)used in the manufacture of CalComplex.
b. For Naticol HPMG you do not have specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of proteins used in the manufacture of CalComplex.
c. For Aquamin F you do not have specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of(b)(4)used in the manufacture of CalComplex.
d. For(b)(4)you do not have specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of(b)(4)used in the Chromium Picolinate dietary supplement.
e. For Calcium Pyruvate you do not have specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of(b)(4)used in the manufacture of Calcium Pyruvate.
In addition to establishing these specifications, you must determine whether such specifications are met, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 111.75.
We have reviewed your response dated December 7 ,2023, which included revised specifications for the ingredients Calcium Pyruvate,(b)(4); and finished product specifications for Chromium Picolinate, CalComplex, and Calcium Pyruvate. Your revised specifications do not meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2) in that they do not include appropriate specifications to ensure the purity and composition of Chromium Picolinate, Calcium Pyruvate and CalComplex.
3. Your quality control approved and released for distribution a batch of dietary supplement for which a component in the batch did not meet its identity specification, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(b)(1). Specifically,(b)(4)Analytical/Chemical Certificate of Analysis dated 9/23/22 for Calcium Pyruvate Lot(b)(4)includes an out-of-specification result of(b)(4)for Calcium. The specification is(b)(4). The ingredient was used in the manufacture of Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822 on 9/9/22, which was prior to testing. Your quality control approved and released the batch on 10/21/22.
4. Your quality control operations failed to approve and release all components from quarantine before they are used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.120(e). Specifically, you used the following components in manufacture before your quality control personnel approved and released them from quarantine:
a. You used Aquamin F Lot(b)(4)on 6/28/23 in the manufacture of CalComplex Lot 523008; however, the dietary ingredient was not approved and released from quarantine until 10/10/23.
b. You used Calcium Pyruvate Lot(b)(4)on 9/8/22 in the manufacture of Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822; however, the dietary ingredient was not approved and released from quarantine until 9/26/22.
We have reviewed your response dated December 7 ,2023, in which you state you investigated and concluded that personnel turnover and insufficient training was the most probable cause of the component’s documented release timing delay. Additionally, you state CalComplex Lot 523008 and Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822 met all strength claims. You provided finished product strength test results for CalComplex Lot 523008 and Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822, updated procedure 12-D-01 (Raw material Component Identity Testing), and staff training records; however, you did not provide documentation to support that your quality control operations are approving and releasing from quarantine all components before use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement.
5. Your quality control operations failed to approve for release, or reject, any packaged and labeled dietary supplements for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.127(h). Specifically, your distribution records show that your quality control signed and released Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223 on 7/18/2023, after the finished dietary supplement was shipped on 6/19/2023. Your distribution records further show that your quality control signed and released CalComplex Lot 523008 on 8/22/2023, after the finished dietary supplement was shipped on 8/9/2023.We have reviewed your response dated December 7, 2023, in which you state there was confusion and disorganization of the batch records which unintentionally led to unexpected timing gaps between shipping to the client and your formal material release paperwork. You also provided your updated procedure 12-E-01 Testing and Release of Finished Product, training records, and updated disposition records for Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223 and CalComplex Lot 523008. However, you did not provide documentation to support that you are distributing finished dietary supplements only after approval and release by your quality control unit.
6. You failed to prepare and follow master manufacturing records that include written instructions that include specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, and specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.205 and 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1) and (h)(3). Specifically, your manufacturing records for CalComplex, Calcium Pyruvate, and Chromium Picolinate do not include written instructions for manufacturing, packaging, and labeling steps, nor do the records identify those points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement.
We have reviewed your response dated December 7 ,2023, in which you provided revised MMR templates for the CalComplex, Calcium Pyruvate, and Chromium Picolinate. However, we are unable to fully evaluate your proposed corrective actions because you did not provide documentation demonstrating that you have implemented and are following your corrective action in the master manufacturing records for a manufactured batch of CalComplex, Calcium Pyruvate, and Chromium Picolinate.
7. Your batch production record failed to include all information required by 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically:
a. Batch production records for Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822, Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223, and CalComplex Lot 523008 failed to include a statement of the actual yield at appropriate phases of the processing, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(f);
b. Batch production records for Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822, Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223, and CalComplex Lot 523008 failed to include the identity of each component used, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(e). For example, the Master Formula page for Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822 has the weigh out of each component that totals(b)(4); however, there is a(b)(4)set of weights(b)(4)that does not have the identity of the component documented;c. Batch production records for Calcium Pyruvate Lot 150822, Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223, and CalComplex Lot 523008 failed to include an actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(k)(2);
d. Batch production records did not include documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel reviewed the batch production records, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l)(1). Specifically, for Chromium Picolinate Lot 40223, there was no quality review sign off for labeling and packaging materials. For CalComplex Lot 523008 there was no quality review sign off for labeling materials.
We have reviewed your response dated December 7 ,2023. Your response includes updated BPRs. However, we are unable to further evaluate your response since it did not include any evidence that you have implemented the proposed corrective actions in executed batch production records.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the Calcium Pyruvate, Chromium Picolinate, and Calcium Complex Formula #3 (CalComplex) products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The Calcium Pyruvate and Chromium Picolinate products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the labels fail to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person, as described in section 761 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379aa-1] may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
2. The CalComplex, Calcium Pyruvate, and Chromium Picolinate products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 (q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of these products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9. For example:
a. For the CalComplex product:i. The presentation of the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients is not in the order as set forth in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B). For example, the declaration of calcium must appear before the declaration of phosphorus.
b. For your Calcium Pyruvate product:i. The title, “Supplement Facts”, is not set at full width of the nutrition label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i).ii. The label lists calcium pyruvate which is not the nomenclature specified for calcium in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8) or 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2). The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from"", e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium pyruvate)"". When a source ingredient is not identified within the nutrition label, it shall be listed in an ingredient statement [21 CFR 101.36(d)].iii. The Supplement Facts label must list the % Daily Value for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients by calculating the dietary ingredient’s quantitative amount by weight per serving divided by the established RDI noted in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), and expressed to the nearest whole percent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B).iv. The Supplement Facts label format requirements including the use of bolded text, hairlines, and/or light and heavy bars are not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e).
c. For the Chromium Picolinate product:i. The title, “Supplement Facts”, is not set at full width of the nutrition label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i).ii. The Supplement Facts label must list the % Daily Value for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients by calculating the dietary ingredient’s quantitative amount by weight per serving divided by the established RDI noted in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), and expressed to the nearest whole percent, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B).iii. The Supplement Facts label format requirements including the use of bolded text, hairlines, and/or light and heavy bars are not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also have the following comments:
For the CalComplex product, the statement “Allergen Warning” appears before the Contains statement, which is considered intervening material.
We note that the CalComplex product declares “Naticol Marine Collagen.” Naticol’s website at https://www.naticol.com/en/naticol-en/ describes their ingredients as “a range of bioactive and bioavailable marine collagen peptides of natural origin.” If the dietary ingredient used in this product is marine peptides, that ingredient must be declared by its common or usual name.
For the Cal Complex product, “Aquamin™” is not the common or usual name forLithothamnionspp.
For the Calcium Pyruvate product, the statement “**Daily Value not Established” must bewithin the Supplements Facts label.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER
July 9, 2024
WL 672905
Dear Mr. McBride:
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 571 Armstrong Way, Oakdale, CA, from October 24 through November 9, 2023.
Based on inspectional findings and review of the product labeling collected during the inspection, we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations.
You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov. At the conclusion of the inspection on November 9, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483).
We acknowledge receipt of your response dated December 5, 2023, and we address your responses below.
Unapproved New Drug
FDA reviewed product labeling for(b)(4)product following the inspection of your facility between October 24 and November 9, 2023. The claims on the product labeling establish that the product(b)(4)is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)], because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims that provide evidence that the product is intended for use as a drug include:
Product name,(b)(4): The product name implies the product is intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent migraines.
On the finished product label for(b)(4):
“(b)(4).”
“(b)(4).”
The(b)(4)product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on October 24, 2023, through November 9, 2023, identified significant violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet cGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, these violations cause the(b)(4)product manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act. Also, in addition to being an unapproved new drug, your(b)(4)product is likewise an adulterated dietary supplement for the same reason.
Your significant violations of dietary supplement cGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish component specifications for each component that you used in the manufacture of your(b)(4)dietary supplement, as required under 21 CFR 111.70(b).
Specifically, during the inspection, the investigator noted that you failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Notably, your(b)(4)and(b)(4)component specification sheets are lacking heavy metal specifications. These two components, which are used to manufacture the(b)(4)product, are botanicals and are at risk for heavy metal contamination.
2. You failed to establish product specifications for strength of the finished batch for each dietary supplement that you manufacture to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
Specifically, as observed during the inspection, you failed to establish product specification for strength for each finished batch of your(b)(4)product. We received and reviewed your December 5, 2023 written response and determined it inadequate. Your finished product specification sheet for your(b)(4)product is lacking adequate strength specifications. The method listed on the finished product specification sheet for determining the strength of(b)(4), and(b)(4)in the finished product is by “input.” While measuring input may be a useful process control, it is not an appropriate test method for determining the strength specification of these ingredients in the finished batch of dietary supplement.

We reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the(b)(4)and(b)(4)products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Thus, in addition to being an unapproved new drug, your(b)(4)product is also a misbranded dietary supplement. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. The terms ""serving"" or ""serving size"" for a dietary supplement are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2, as the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion. For example, the serving size declared in the Supplement Facts label for all intended groups is 2 caplets, whereas the recommended use is one caplet twice a day with food for children(b)(4)years. Furthermore, there is no correlation between the serving size for children ages(b)(4)years that appears in the Supplement Facts label and the recommended use that appears on the product labeling.
2. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] because the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of each product label does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a.(b)(4)
The title, “Supplement Facts”, is not set at full width of the nutrition label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).
A light bar is not placed beneath the heading “Amount Per Serving”, which as not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(7).
The subheading “Servings Per Container” does not appear under the subheading “Serving Size”, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
The dietary ingredients that comprise the proprietary blend do not appear to be indented, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).
There is no provision in the regulation for the footnote symbol *** to link to a statement within the Supplement Facts label that describes the constituents of the proprietary blend.
b.(b)(4)
A heavy bar is not placed beneath the final (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(ii).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
1. We note that the(b)(4)finished product specification for Lead is <(b)(4)ppm and for Arsenic is <(b)(4)ppm. Your batch record for(b)(4)batch(b)(4)reports lead results of(b)(4)ppm. Under 21 CFR 111.70(e), you must establish specifications for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement. We request that your response address the scientific basis for setting a specification for lead at <(b)(4)ppm as a level that will not adulterate the dietary supplement.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: CMS 681493
Dear Jonathan and Zachary Daye,
This is to advise you that the the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website, https://flyingmonkeyusa.com, in May 2024, and has determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your products, Flying Monkey Mango Tango Gummies, Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Mango Gummies, and Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Blueberry Gummies are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd
FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Flying Monkey Mango Tango Gummies, Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Mango Gummies, and Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Blueberry Gummies are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. In addition, FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that samples of these products contain Delta-8 THC.
As defined in section 201(s) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. Therefore, your Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Mango Tango Gummies, Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Mango Gummies, and Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Blueberry Gummies and other gummies or foods that contain Delta-8 THC are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on a review of your website, https://flyingmonkeyusa.com, your Flying Monkey Mango Tango Gummies, Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Mango Gummies, and Flying Monkey Heavy Hitter Blend Blueberry Gummies (collectively, “Delta-8 50 mg THC Gummy products”) are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act 321(g)(1)(B)] of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your website, https://flyingmonkeyusa.com that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Under the product listing for “Delta-8 50mg THC Gummies, 20ct”:
“One of the main positives of Delta-8 THC is its potential therapeutic benefits. It is believed to have anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties, making it a potential treatment for a range of conditions such as arthritis, migraines, and neuropathic pain. Delta-8 THC may also help alleviate nausea and vomiting, making it a potential alternative to prescription drugs.”
Your Delta-8 50mg THC Gummy products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. There are no FDA approved applications in effect for the above-mentioned product. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the cause(s) of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
We note that your firm sells food products that contain cannabinoids other than Delta-8 THC. We know of no basis to conclude that any use in food of a cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, would be safe and lawful. For some cannabinoids, such as Delta-8 THC, the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm. For other cannabinoids, there is little or no available information concerning the safety of their use in food. No cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, is approved for any use in food as a food additive. Moreover, we know of no basis to conclude that any intended use in food of any cannabinoid satisfies the criteria for eligibility for GRAS status.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days from your receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 681493” in the subject line of your email.

RE: 674917
Dear Mr. Willis:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.lifeleafmedical.com in November 2023, in January, March, and April 2024, and in June 2024, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various products that you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Delta-8 THC Nerd Ropes (various flavors), Stoneos Delta-8 Cookies, and Delta-8 Cereal Treats are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act.

You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.

See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (e.g., candy, cookies and snacks) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023, FDA received over 300 adverse event reports describing children and adults who consumed Delta-8 THC products. Nearly half of the reports involved hospitalization or emergency department visits, and approximately two-thirds described adverse events after ingestion of Delta-8 THC-containing food products such as candy or brownies. Your Delta-8 THC Nerd Ropes (various flavors), Stoneos Delta-8 Cookies, and Delta-8 Cereal Treats are in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Delta-8 THC Nerd Ropes (various flavors), Stoneos Delta-8 Cookies, and Delta-8 Cereal Treats are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks.  Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984)); see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to conventional snack foods often consumed by children. Your Delta 8 THC Nerds Rope product strongly resembles Nerds Rope candy, with both products comprising multi-colored crunchy candies attached to a gummy rope. Further, the packaging for your product features a brightly-colored background, the blue and white Nerds logo, and what appears to be the Nerds mascot (a cartoon anthropomorphic Nerds candy with two eyes, a prominent round nose, and two legs. Your Delta-8 THC Cereal Treats are sold in packaging that not only depicts multi-colored crispy rice cereal on the front, but also is clear plastic on the back side, clearly revealing the crispy rice cereal treats inside. Your Double Stuff Stoneo cookies are sold in packaging that mimics that of Nabisco Double Stuf Oreos. The packaging for both features a large single chocolate sandwich cookie accompanied by a splash of milk pictured against a dark blue background, and the “Stoneo” logo mimics the Oreo logo, with both featuring white text in all caps with a gray drop shadow, set against a blue background that is outlined in a lighter shade of blue.
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended to Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov within 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

WARNING LETTER
RE: 675517
To Whom It May Concern:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://shamrockshrooms.com in October 2023, February and March 2024, and in June 2024, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various products that you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Errlli Delta-8 THC Shark Gummies, Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Brite Crawlers, and Errlli Delta-8 Sour Glowworms, are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (e.g., candy) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023, FDA received over 300 adverse event reports describing children and adults who consumed Delta-8 THC products. Nearly half of the reports involved hospitalization or emergency department visits, and approximately two-thirds described adverse events after ingestion of Delta-8 THC-containing food products such as candy or brownies. Your Errlli Delta- 8 THC Shark Gummies, Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Brite Crawlers, and Errlli Delta-8 Sour Glowworms are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Errlli Delta-8 THC Gummy Sharks, Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Brite Crawlers, Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Glowworms, are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. Therefore, your Errlli Delta- 8 THC Gummy Sharks, Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Brite Crawlers, and Errlli Delta-8 THC Sour Glowworms are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of FDA’s concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
We note that your firm sells food products that contain cannabinoids other than Delta-8 THC. We know of no basis to conclude that any use in food of a cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, would be safe and lawful.  For some cannabinoids, such as Delta-8 THC, the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm. For other cannabinoids, there is little or no available information concerning the safety of their use in food. No cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, is approved for any use in food as a food additive. Moreover, we know of no basis to conclude that any intended use in food of any cannabinoid satisfies the criteria for eligibility for GRAS status.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 675517” in the subject line of your email.
Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984)); see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your various Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to candy often consumed by children. All of your Errlli Delta-8 THC gummy products are sold in packaging that resembles that for Trolli gummy candies, including the use of the same puffy font for “Errlli” that is used in the Trolli logo. The package design for your Errlli Sour Brite Crawlers is nearly identical to that for Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers, including the use of a mottled blue background with solid black at the top and bottom, the depiction of multi-colored gummy worms, the identical font and similar color scheme used for the product name “SOUR BRITE Crawlers,” and the identical position of the clear window that allows viewing of the package contents. The packaging for all three of your Errlli Delta-8 gummy products includes a clear window on the front that allows viewing of the gummies inside.
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended to Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov within 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

2Under section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (candy, chips, and cookies) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023, FDA received over 300 adverse event reports describing children and adults who consumed Delta-8 THC products. Nearly half of the reports involved hospitalization or emergency department visits, and approximately two-thirds described adverse events after ingestion of Delta-8 THC-containing food products such as candy or brownies. Your Stoney Sour Gummy Bears: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Ranchers Hard Candy: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Dank Ropes: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Patch Sour Watermelon Slices: 1,000 mg Delta-8 THC, Slizzles: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Flaming Hot Weedos: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, and Trips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies: 1,000 mg Delta-8 THC products are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Stoney Sour Gummy Bears: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Ranchers Hard Candy: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Dank Ropes: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Patch Sour Watermelon Slices: 1,000 mg Delta-8 THC, Slizzles: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Flaming Hot Weedos: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, and Trips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies: 1,000 mg Delta-8 THC are products to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. Therefore, your Stoney Sour Gummy Bears: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Ranchers Hard Candy: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Dank Ropes: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Stoney Patch Sour Watermelon Slices: 1,000 mg Delta-8 THC, Slizzles: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, Flaming Hot Weedos: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC, and Trips Ahoy Chocolate Chip Cookies: 1,000mg Delta-8 THC products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
We note that your firm sells food products that contain cannabinoids other than Delta-8 THC. We know of no basis to conclude that any use in food of a cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, would be safe and lawful.  For some cannabinoids, such as Delta-8 THC, the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm. For other cannabinoids, there is little or no available information concerning the safety of their use in food. No cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, is approved for any use in food as a food additive. Moreover, we know of no basis to conclude that any intended use in food of any cannabinoid satisfies the criteria for eligibility for GRAS status.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 678010” in the subject line of your email.
Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984)); see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your various Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to conventional snack foods often consumed by children. Your Trips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies are sold in packaging that closely resembles that for Nabisco Chips Ahoy cookies, including the use of a blue background, the depiction of a chocolate chip cookie with a bite taken out on the left side displayed underneath the word “ORIGINAL” in all caps in a white font that mimics handwriting, and the use of a similar color scheme and font for the “Trips Ahoy!” logo as that used for Chips Ahoy! logo. Your Slizzles product comes in packaging closely resembling that for Sour Skittles, including the use of a lime green background, the inclusion of a rainbow ribbon graphical element, the depiction of colored oblate spheroid candies printed with a white small letter “s,” and the use of a similar font for the white “Slizzles” logo as that used for Skittles, including the use of a piece of candy to dot the letter “i.” Similarly, the packaging for your Stoney Patch Sour Watermelon Slices, Stoney Ranchers Hard Candy, Dank Ropes, and Flaming Hot Weedos contain color schemes and graphical elements that resemble those for Sour Patch Kids Watermelon Candy, Jolly Rancher hard candy, Nerds Rope, and Flamin’ Hot Cheetos, respectively. Your Stoney Sour Gummy Bears are sold in a package that is in the shape of a gummy bear and that further depicts multiple smaller gummy bears.
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended to Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC gummy products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov within 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

WARNING LETTER
RE: 677031
Dear Mr. Hill and Ms. Romejko:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.hippymood.com in January, March and June 2024, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various products that you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Slushers Delta-8 Candy, Chuckles Peach Rings Delta-8 Candy, Rainbow Ropes Delta-8 Candy, Doweedos Delta-8 Edible Chips, Rainbow Rings Delta-8, Chocolate Balls Delta-8 Cereal, Cookie Cat Crunch Delta-8 Cereal, Frutti Rocks Delta-8 Cereal, and Berry Boss Delta 8 Cereal products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.

Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984)); see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to conventional snack foods often consumed by children. Your various Delta-8 THC cereal products – Berry Boss, Chocolate Balls, Cookie Cat Crunch, Frutti Rocks, and Rainbow Rings – are sold in packing that uses color schemes and other graphical elements causing them to resemble packaging for popular children’s cereals. For example, the Rainbow Rings Delta 8 Cereal package features a cartoon toucan on a red background, depicts ring-shaped cereal in multiple colors, and displays the name of the product all capital letters in a white font, with a piece of colored cereal substituting for the letter “O,” which are all elements that are also present in the packaging for Kellogg’s Froot Loops cereal. Likewise, the packaging for your Berry Boss Delta 8 product has a yellow background, depicts cereal that appears similar to Cap’n Crunch Crunch Berries (yellow pillow-shaped cereal mixed with larger round pink, green, and blue cereal pieces), features a cartoon character wearing a blue bicorne hat similar in design to that worn by the Cap’n Crunch mascot, and also displays the name of the product in a similar color scheme and style to that of Cap’n Crunch’s Crunch Berries (with the first word in white lettering, the second word in red lettering, and both words set against a blue background). Packaging for other Delta-8 THC products you sell include clear plastic windows that make it possible for children to view their contents, which are visually indistinguishable from conventional candies (including Chuckle Peach Rings and Rainbow Ropes), and/or include graphical elements that imitate conventional foods commonly consumed by children or that are otherwise appealing to children (such as the graphical elements that make the packaging for Dr. Blaze Gummies resemble that for Fruit Gushers fruit snacks, or the anthropomorphic orange tortilla chip on the Doweedos package).
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended to Cliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).

RE: 674690
Dear Mr. Gustafson and Mrs. Edior-Gustafson:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address growgod.org in February and March 2024, and has determined that you take orders there for various food products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act.

You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (candy and chips) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1From January 1, 2021, through December 31, 2023, FDA received over 300 adverse event reports describing children and adults who consumed Delta-8 THC products. Nearly half of the reports involved hospitalization or emergency department visits, and approximately two-thirds described adverse events after ingestion of Delta-8 THC-containing food products such as candy or brownies. Your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act. Therefore, your Medicated Funyuns – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Doritos – GrowGod™ Delta-8, Infused Gushers – GrowGod™ Delta-8, and Cheetos Flamin’ Hot Crunchy – GrowGod™ Delta-8 products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
We note that your firm sells food products that contain cannabinoids other than Delta-8 THC. We know of no basis to conclude that any use in food of a cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, would be safe and lawful.  For some cannabinoids, such as Delta-8 THC, the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm. For other cannabinoids, there is little or no available information concerning the safety of their use in food. No cannabinoid, plant derived or otherwise, is approved for any use in food as a food additive. Moreover, we know of no basis to conclude that any intended use in food of any cannabinoid satisfies the criteria for eligibility for GRAS status.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 674690” in the subject line of your email.

WARNING LETTER
June 25, 2024
24-HAFE4-WL-02 / CMS No. 679765Dear Mr. Ramirez:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.naturgin.com in June 2024 and has determined that you take orders for the products Syrup for Children Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera; Syrup for Adults Ginger and Honey; Syrup for Adults Forte Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera; AFA Blue Green Algae 1000 mg; Magnesium Complex All in One Capsule Magnesium and Potassium; and Vitamin C 1000 mg/caps. We also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/naturgin/ where you direct consumers to your website, www.naturgin.com, to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:

Further, your social media website, https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2816687698585430&set=ecnf.100063623525475 also contains evidence of intended use of your products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. For example, your Facebook post on February 25, 2021, for Syrup for Adults Forte Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera states:
“Take it from 2 to 3 times (Spoonful) per day to maintain a clean throat and to avoid the flu.”
“Helps…pain of the throat.”
“In case of flu, cough or throat pain take it every 2 hours until nuisance disappears.
Your Syrup for Children Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera; Syrup for Adults Ginger and Honey; Syrup for Adults Forte Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera; AFA Blue Green Algae 1000 mg; Magnesium Complex All in One Capsule Magnesium and Potassium; and Vitamin C 1000 mg/caps products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Syrup for Children Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera and Syrup for Adults Forte Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera products are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Syrup for Children Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera and Syrup for Adults Forte Ginger, Honey, and Aloe Vera products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

WARNING LETTERCMS #667601
Dear Dr. Bush,
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 4351 Seminole Trail, Charlottesville, Virginia from June 12 through August 31, 2023. Based on inspectional findings and review of the product labels collected during the inspection, as well as review of your website at www.Intelligenceofnature.com, we have identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection on August 31, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We acknowledge receipt of your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. We address your responses below, when relevant information from such response(s) pertained to a particular issue.
Adulterated Human Drugs
FDA Tested Samples
FDA conducted laboratory testing of a lot of ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support Nasal Spray drug product and results demonstrate that this drug product is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(1), in that it consists in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance.
FDA laboratory analysis determined that a sample of your ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support Nasal Spray drug product was grossly contaminated with microorganisms. This gross contamination is particularly concerning because your drug product is a nasal spray.
FDA laboratory testing of ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support Nasal Spray drug product lot 2302081HGA found gross microbial contamination. The individual sample results varied between 510,000 and up to 1,100,000 colony forming units (CFU)/mL for total aerobic microbial count and between 290 and up to 1,100 CFU/mL for total yeast and mold counts. Therefore, this drug product is adulterated under section 501(a)(1) of the Act.
Microorganisms identified includedMicrobacterium sp., Fictibacillus sp., Bacillus sp. (primarily B. malikii), andPaenibacillus sp.The high bioburden in conjunction with the route of administration with this drug product poses a high risk of harm to vulnerable patients.
On September 22, 2023, the FDA held a teleconference with you. During the teleconference, you agreed to conduct a voluntary recall of all lots of ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support Nasal Spray.
On September 29, 2023, you voluntarily recalled all lots of ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support Nasal Spray, ION Sinus, and Restore Sinus Spray products to the consumer level due to microbial contamination identified asMicrobacterium sp., Fictibacillus sp., Bacillus sp.(primarilyB. malikii), andPaenibacillus sp., as noted on the following FDA website:https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/biomic-sciences-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-ion-sinus-support-ion-sinus-and-restore-sinus
Drug CGMP Violations
The inspection of your facility from June 12 through August 31, 2023, identified significant violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
1. Your firm failed to conduct, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory testing, as necessary, required to be free of objectionable microorganisms (21 CFR 211.165(b)).
Your firm released finished drug product without adequate testing for critical microbial attributes (i.e., testing to ensure absence of objectionable microorganisms). Without appropriate testing of each lot of drug product required to be free of objectionable microorganisms prior to release, you did not have scientific evidence that the lots were free of microbial contamination that is objectionable in view of its intended use. Particularly for a drug product that is intended for use as a nasal spray, it is essential that your drug products are tested for microbial contamination to minimize the risk of patient exposure to significant numbers or harmful species of microorganisms, harmful microbial metabolites and/or toxins, and drug spoilage or degradation.
You also stated during the inspection that you add(b)(4)to numerous drug product formulations to control microbial growth. Preservatives are not a substitute for a comprehensive approach to preventing objectionable microorganisms from contaminating your drug product and cannot be relied on to reduce in-process bioburden during manufacturing. Additionally, long term use of medicinal compounds containing(b)(4)may(b)(4). Levels of(b)(4)exposure that have led to(b)(4)documented and therefore, it is not possible to establish minimum levels that are safe.
In your September 22, 2023, response, you state that you stopped producing and discontinued sales of the current formulation of ION Intelligence of Nature Sinus Support but plan to market a nasal product in the future. You state that you are revising your written procedures for quality unit (QU) responsibilities, including to specifically establish adequate testing of your finished product and water used in production of your products. You also state that you are revising procedures to ensure all applicable tests impacting the identity, strength, quality, and purity of your products are established and performed.
In response to this letter, clarify whether you plan to resume manufacturing drug products at this facility in the future for marketing in the United States. We request that you notify this office before you market such drug products.
2. Your firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).
Your firm failed to establish an adequate QU with responsibilities to ensure adequate oversight for the manufacture of your drug products. For example, your QU failed to ensure:
Adequate procedures that are designed to prevent objectionable microbiological contamination of drug products (21 CFR 211.113(a)).
Adequate testing of components with potential for microbiological contamination that is objectionable in view of its intended use (21 CFR 211.84(d)(6)).
Procedures are followed to adequately establish, review, and approve master manufacturing records prior to use (21 CFR 211.100(a)).
Adequate batch records to document the mixing and packaging of your drug product (21 CFR 211.188).
Establishment of an adequate stability program to support expiration dating of your drug products (including microbiological attributes) (21 CFR 211.166(a)).
Adequate documentation for QU review and release of drug product. (21 CFR 211.22(a)).
Additionally, your QU was unaware of the identity of numerous proprietary components used to manufacture many of your drug products, and therefore could not have fulfilled their QU responsibilities to ensure all components meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity.
Your firm’s quality systems are inadequate. You may refer to FDA’s guidance documentQuality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulationsfor help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.
CGMP Consultant Recommended
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, you should engage a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements if your firm intends to resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. The qualified consultant should also perform a comprehensive six-system1audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA.
Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.
Adulterated & Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Adulterated Low Acid Canned Food Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on June 12 through August 31, 2023, identified serious violations of the Emergency Permit Control regulation Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 108 (21 CFR Part 108) and the Thermally Processed Low-Acid Foods Packaged in Hermetically Sealed Containers regulation (21 CFR Part 113). These violations cause your products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(4), in that they were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.
As a manufacturer of low acid canned food products, you are required to comply with the Act and the Federal regulations relating to the processing of low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers. The Emergency Permit Control regulations were issued, in part, pursuant to section 404 of the Act, Emergency Permit Control, 21 U.S.C. 344. A temporary emergency permit may be required for thermally processed low-acid foods packaged in hermetically sealed containers whenever a processor has failed to fulfill the requirements of 21 CFR 108.35, including registration and filing of process information, and the mandatory requirements in 21 CFR Parts 113. Regulations specific to the processing of LACF products are described in 21 CFR 108 and 21 CFR 113.
1. You did not register with the FDA as a commercial processor of low-acid foods. A commercial processor of low-acid foods is required, not later than 10 days after first engaging in the manufacture, processing, and packaging of thermally processed low-acid foods in hermetically sealed containers in any state, as defined in section 201(a)(1) of the Act, to register and file a Form FDA 2541 (food canning establishment registration) with the FDA, as required by 21 CFR 108.35(c)(1). However, your firm processes Ion Gut Support, a low-acid food, without registering with the FDA.
2. You must file the scheduled processes with the FDA for each low-acid food in each container size as required by 21 CFR 108.35(c)(2). This filing must occur not later than 60 days after registration and prior to the packing of a new product and include the processing method, type of retort or other thermal processing equipment employed, minimum initial temperatures, times and temperatures of processing, sterilizing value, or other equivalent scientific evidence of process adequacy, critical control factors affecting heat penetration, and source and date of the establishment of the process, for each product in each container size. Specifically, as noted during the inspection, your firm did not file a scheduled process with FDA for your Ion Gut Support product. Further, a scheduled process shall be established by a qualified person who has expert knowledge acquired through appropriate training and experience in the acidification and processing of, as required by 21 CFR 113.83
Your response indicates that you have initiated contact with a process authority,(b)(4). We acknowledge that you have initiated actions. However, this violation remains uncorrected.
Scheduled process information for low-acid foods processed by retort must be submitted on Form FDA 2541d (Food Process Filing for Low-Acid Retorted Method) and low-acid foods controlled by water activity must be submitted on Form FDA 2541f (Food Process Filing for Water Activity/Formulation Control Method). More information on registration and filing can be found in the publication “Guidance for Industry: Submitting Form FDA 2541 (Food Canning Establishment Registration) and Forms FDA 2541d, FDA 2541e, FDA 2541f, and FDA 2541g (Food Process Filing Forms) to FDA in Electronic or Paper Format” available at http://www.fda.gov/food/guidanceregulation/guidancedocumentsregulatoryinformation/ucm309376.htm.
Violations of Dietary Supplement CGMPs
The inspection of your facility from June 12 through August 31, 2023, identified serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your Ion Gut Support dietary supplement to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1), because it has been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of dietary supplement CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish identity specifications for each component you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1); component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2); and limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration, of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).
For your components, you purport to use your Biomic Sciences Component Specification sheets as your specifications for raw components(b)(4), used in the manufacture of your Ion Gut Support. However, these specification sheets do not include identity specifications for any of these components, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1); do not establish component specifications for(b)(4)or components(b)(4)that will ensure the purity of your Ion Gut Support, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2); and do not establish contamination specifications for(b)(4), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).(b)(4)is susceptible to having contaminants not limited to microorganisms and heavy metals.
We have received your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. In your response dated September 22, you state that you are establishing identity component specifications and acceptance criteria using appropriate scientifically valid methods. However, you do not present any supporting evidence for us to evaluate your correction. Your response dated October 31 provides specifications that are for microbial contamination only and does not demonstrate that the requirements of 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met. Your November 15, 2023, and April 24, 2024, responses do not address this citation.
2. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). For example, your product label for ION Gut Support lists the content of Humic Extract (from Ancient Soil) in the product as 5 mg; however, you have not established a strength specification for a finished batch of product to ensure that the label claim is met. For each specification you are required to establish and must take specific actions, after they are established, to verify that the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We have received your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. Your October 31, 2023, response provided finished product specifications for ION Gut Support (SPC-01). However, the documents you provided do not demonstrate that you have corrected the above-mentioned deficiencies. Your remaining responses did not address this issue.
3. You failed to quarantine components before you used them in the manufacture of a dietary supplement until quality control could conduct the required review and approval of such components, as required per 21 CFR 111.155(c). Specifically, during the inspection, our investigator observed that you did not place(b)(4)or(b)(4), used in the manufacture of your Ion Gut Support, into quarantine for evaluation and release by Quality Control prior to use. Additionally, you have no records that document you quarantined, sampled, and analyzed select components prior to their use. As an example, you received(b)(4)from your supplier on January 17, 2022. You did not document the quarantine, sampling, or analysis of this component. You used this component on(b)(4), to manufacture(b)(4). You then used this(b)(4)in the manufacturing of Ion Gut Support, 8-oz., Lot 2303301HBA, which was released into commerce.
We received your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. In your October 31, 2023, response, you state you have established a quarantine area in “(b)(4)” and provided a photograph. However, you did not present any records or evidence that components are being quarantined, sampled, and analyzed in accordance with your written procedure. Your remaining responses did not address this issue. Therefore, your responses fail to demonstrate the sufficiency of your corrective actions.
4. Your batch production record failed to include all the information required under 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, we reviewed your batch production record for Ion Gut Support and found it failed to contain the following required information:
The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained (21 CFR 111.260(c)).
The identity and weight or measurement of water and(b)(4)components in the(b)(4)and(b)(4)respectively (21 CFR 111.260(e)).
Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch, the initials of the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure of each component used in the batch, the initials of the person responsible for adding the component to the batch, and the initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch (21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)).
We have received your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. In your response dated October 31, 2023, you provided the MPR template for(b)(4). However, it does not include all elements as required in 21 CFR 111.260. Your remaining responses did not address this issue.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for calibrating instruments and controls you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.25(a). Specifically, you have not established written procedures for calibrating your(b)(4), which you use in the manufacturing or testing of your Ion Gut Support.
We have received your responses dated September 22, October 31, and November 15, 2023; and April 24, 2024. However, none of your responses provided documentation to demonstrate that you have established and followed written procedures for calibrating your(b)(4). Therefore, we cannot evaluate the sufficiency of your corrective actions.
Misbranding of Dietary Supplement Products
In addition, we reviewed your product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the Ion Gut Support dietary supplement product you manufacture and distribute is misbranded under section 403 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 343, because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Ion Gut Support dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(i)(2) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(i)(2), in that the product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4.
The Supplement Facts panel of your product identifies “Humic Extract” as the active ingredient with only “Purified water” as the other ingredient. We reviewed and collected your batch production records, which document formulation, of all sizes of your Ion Gut Support product. According to your batch production records, your Ion Gut Support includes the following ingredients:(b)(4)purified water,(b)(4).
Each ingredient must be declared by the common or usual name in descending order of predominance within the ingredient list unless an exemption is provided in 21 CFR 101.100, or a collective (generic) name is provided in 21 CFR 101.4.
In your response, you state your components, other than humic extract, are processing aids to create the extraction. However, you provide no evidence these components are not present in the finished product. Further, the(b)(4)product (which is a product that consists of:(b)(4)are added after the extraction process. Thus, they are not processing aids as defined under 21 CFR 101.100(a)(3)(ii). Therefore, your response is inadequate.
2. Your Ion Gut Support products are misbranded under 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(5)(F), because the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of each product label does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
The Supplement Facts label is not enclosed in a box by using hairlines (21 CFR 101.36(e)(2)).
A heavy bar is not placed under the “Serving Per Container” heading (21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(i)).
A light bar is not placed under the heading “Amount Per Serving” (21 CFR 101.36(e)(7)).
A heavy bar is not placed under the final other ingredient (21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(iii)).
The title, “Supplement Facts”, and headings are not bolded (21 CFR 101.36(e)(1)).
There is no provision in the regulation for an Other Ingredients list to appear within the Supplement Facts label.
In your response, you state you will address items within the Supplement Facts label. However, you do not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate corrections. Therefore, your response is insufficient for us to evaluate corrections.
3. Your Ion Gut Support product is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(q)(1)(A), because the Supplement Facts label does not include all intended groups as noted in the label directions. If a product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns. Your product’s Supplement Facts labels do not clearly include all the intended groups with the serving size and nutrition information in separate columns in the Supplement Facts label, as required by 21 CFR 101.36. For example, your Frequently Asked Questions found on your website, https://intelligenceofnature.com/pages/frequently-asked-questions#skin, and the product’s bottle labeling provide directions for use for adults and children under 3; however, both those intended groups are not declared on your product’s Supplement Facts labels.
In your response, you state you will change the directions of use to indicate oral use only and specify the use is for children four years and older. You do not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate corrections. Therefore, your response is inadequate.
4. Your Ion Gut Support product appears to be misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C 343(s)(2)(B), in that the statement of identity provided on the principal display panel is “mineral supplement”, but there is no mineral declared as a dietary ingredient, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3(g).
In your response dated September 22, 2023, you state you will update your labeling by March 31, 2024. However, you did not present sufficient evidence to demonstrate corrections. Therefore, we cannot evaluate the sufficiency of your corrective actions.

RE: 664700
Dear David Woods:
This letter concerns your product 213° Metabolism Boosting Complex, which is labeled as a dietary supplement. Your product labeling declares N-Methyltyramine as a dietary ingredient in 213° Metabolism Boosting Complex. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) because the product is an adulterated dietary supplement. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
The term “dietary supplement” is defined in section 201(ff) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. NMethyltyramine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the Act because it is a constituent of various botanicals. N-Methyltyramine is also a “new dietary ingredient” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that N-Methyltyramine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, N-Methyltyramine is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. FDA has not received any new dietary ingredient notifications pertaining to the use of NMethyltyramine in dietary supplements. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such adulterated dietaty supplements into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify FDA in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to Dr. Aaron Dotson, Compliance Officer, via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.

Your social media website, Productos naturales Alpagi | Facebook, also contains evidence of intended use of your products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. For example, your Facebook post on May 3, 2023, states, “Con la BioMoringa podrás prevenir patologías como diabetes, cholesterol, cáncer, ayuda en el Sistema inmunológico” (translated to: With BioMoringa you can prevent pathologies such as diabetes, cholesterol, cancer…”). The post further directs consumers to call your store to order the product.
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products BioMoringa, BioDiabetin, Maca Plus, Ginkgo Biloba and BioCell are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your BioMoringa, BioDiabetin, Maca Plus, Ginkgo Biloba and BioCell products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be directed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon A.

Reference: CMS Case # 648130
Dear Ms. Martin:
This is to advise you that the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.ambayagold.com in April and November 2023 and has determined that you take orders for the products Brain Balance, Immune System Boost, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, Silver Solution, Detox Cleanse Renew, Magnesium Oil Spray, Silver Spray, and Pet Health+. We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth, which directs consumers to your website at www.ambayagold.com to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B)/(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(g)(1)(B)/(C)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.

Specifically, these products are intended for use as a first aid antiseptic, and an external analgesic, respectively1
Unapproved New Drugs
Your Brain Balance, Immune System Boost, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, Silver Solution, and Detox Cleanse Renew products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Further, your “Silver Spray” product, containing silver, is a first aid antiseptic subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Specifically, your silver-containing product falls under section 505G(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, because FDA has determined that no silver containing OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective under a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330.2, 3Therefore, Silver Spray is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act is in effect for this drug product. Accordingly, “Silver Spray” is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).
Your “Magnesium Oil Spray” is a topical external analgesic drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G of the of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application —commonly referred to as ""OTC monograph drugs""—may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. With respect to OTC external analgesic drug products, such products are deemed to be GRASE and not new drugs if, among other things, they conform to the conditions of use set forth in the final administrative order, Over-the-Counter Monograph M017: External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (“M017”).4
However, “Magnesium Oil Spray” does not conform to the conditions specified in the final administrative order for the reasons described below. Your “Magnesium Oil Spray” is not formulated and labeled as an external analgesic counterirritant drug product that is consistent with the final administrative order. Specifically, your product is labeled to contain the ingredients magnesium chloride, fulvic, indium, aloe vera, pyridoxine HCl (B6), MSM, and plant based phytonutrients, all of which are outside of the final applicable administrative order. According to 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2), an “active ingredient” means any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of humans. Although your firm does not specifically list these ingredients as active ingredients, your product website includes statements that claim this combination of ingredients is “designed to provide relief from body tension and soreness” as a treatment for symptoms related to magnesium deficiency that include “leg cramps and muscle soreness,” along with “migraines, insomnia, [and] fatigue.” Such statements demonstrate that those ingredients are considered “active ingredients” as defined by 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) because this combination of ingredients is intended to furnish pharmacological activity. However, this combination of active ingredients is not permitted under the applicable final order nor are any of these ingredients permitted as a single active ingredient in an external analgesic product under the final administrative order.
Thus, as formulated and labeled, “Magnesium Oil Spray” does not comply with the final administrative order described above or any applicable proposed or final rule. FDA is not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that “Magnesium Oil Spray” is GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in its labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which this product would be legally marketed without an approved application. Therefore, “Magnesium Oil Spray” is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). Accordingly, “Magnesium Oil Spray” is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).
In addition, “Silver Spray” and “Magnesium Oil Spray” are misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee) because they are nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, are not the subject of applications approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, and do not comply with the requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Brain Balance, Silver Solution, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, and Detox Cleanse Renew products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, the Brain Balance, Silver Solution, Dentist In A Bottle, Essensiac, Fulvic Green, and Detox Cleanse Renew products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
Based on our review of your website www.ambayagold.com and your social media website www.facebook.com/AmbayaGoldHealth, your Pet Health+ product is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal.

Your Pet Health+ product is a ""new animal drug"" under section 201(v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)] because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. Pet Health+ is not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)] and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of an adulterated drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].

1It is not clear whether you intend your “Silver Spray” and “Magnesium Oil Spray” products to be marketed as dietary supplements. Your firm lists these two products on your website under the heading “Supplements.” Under section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)], a dietary supplement is defined, among other things, as a product intended for ingestion. Topical products and other products that are not intended for ingestion cannot be dietary supplements.
2See 21 CFR 310.548(b): ""Any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the Act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the Act.”
3FDA’s final determination was codified in regulations at 21 CFR 310.545(a)(8)(i). Under section 505G(k)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, the non-monograph conditions in 21 CFR 310.545 in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the CARES Act (i.e., March 26, 2020) are deemed to be a final administrative order. The final administrative order is entitled “Non-Monograph Conditions NM900: Drug Products Containing Certain Active Ingredients Offered Over-the-Counter for Certain Uses” (See Order ID OTC000007, available at OTC Monographs@FDA, https://dps.fda.gov/omuf).

WARNING LETTER
23-HAFE4-WL-04/CMS No. 654453CC: Ms. Yvette C. Barreto, Vice president, and Chief Finance Officer (CFO)
Dear Ms. Elias,
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your dietary supplement warehouse and distribution facility, located at 3555 NW 41st St, Miami, Florida, on January 24, 2023, January 25, 2023, and February 1, 2023. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulation for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. We also reviewed your product labeling we collected during the inspection, and found serious violations under Title 21, CFR Part 101, which render your Dr. Sana Cod Liver Oil and Dr. Sana Orange Blossom Flower Water dietary supplement products misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
We received your correspondence sent electronically on February 22, 2023 concerning our inspectional observations listed on the FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address this response below as it relates to the noted observations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplement products are adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements. During the inspection, FDA investigators observed the following significant violations of CGMP regulations for dietary supplements:
1. You did not establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.103, and you did not implement quality control operations, including quality control operations for a material review and disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.113. Specifically, during the inspection, you did not have any written procedures for quality control operations for the dietary supplements you own and distribute. Also, during the inspection, our investigators observed that your firm does not perform any quality control operations for your finished dietary supplements, Dr. Sana brand Cod Liver Oil and Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water, to include approving and releasing products for distribution.
We have reviewed your response, dated February 22, 2023, which included a procedure, “(b)(4),” and your “(b)(4).” These documents assign the product receiving responsibility to the Purchasing Department, including the review of shipment documentation. However, neither document provides your firm’s quality control procedures for dietary supplement products, such as written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision in accordance with 21 CFR 111.113, including products contract manufactured for your firm’s own label.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, during the inspection, you stated that you do not have holding and distribution written procedures.
We have reviewed your response, dated February 22, 2023. Your response included a procedure titled “(b)(4).” This procedure does not address all the requirements under 21 CFR 111, Subpart M. For example, your Dr. Sana brand Cod Liver Oil and your Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water dietary supplement finished product labels list storage temperatures, but your procedure does not include instructions on how to appropriately store these products based on the storage temperatures indicated on the product labels. Per 21 CFR 111.455(a), you must hold components and dietary supplements under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light so that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the components and dietary supplements are not affected.
3. You failed to identify who is responsible for your quality control operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.12(b). Specifically, you did not identify any individual(s) to be responsible for your quality control operations.
Once you identify individual(s) to perform quality control operations, each person must be qualified to do so and have distinct and separate responsibilities related to performing such operations from those responsibilities that the person otherwise has when not performing such operations (21 CFR 111.12(b)).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your Dr. Sana Cod Liver Oil and Dr. Sana Orange Blossom Flower Water products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Dr. Sana Cod Liver Oil product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] because the product label fails to declare the common or usual name of each ingredient in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g). Specifically, the manufacturing records you provided to our investigator regarding Dr. Sana Cod Liver Oil, lot number 220528, demonstrate the product contains Vitamin E and mineral oil as ingredients. These ingredients are not declared on the finished product’s label.
In addition, your Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §343(i)(2)] in that the product label declares Orange Blossom Flower Water as an ingredient. The batch production record for the product declares the ingredient Orange Blossom Distillate Flower Water which is fabricated from two or more ingredients. The ingredient list fails to declare the individual ingredients that make up the Orange Blossom Distillate Flower Water as required by 21 CFR 101.4(a) and (g).
2. Your Dr. Sana brand Cod Liver Oil and your Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because the product label contains information in two languages but does not repeat all of the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language. The product includes foreign language on the label but fails to declare all subsequent information in the Supplements Facts label in both languages as required.
3. Your Dr. Sana Cod Liver product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example,• Calories per serving fails to be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9(c).• Total fat per serving fails to be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9• Vitamin D per serving fails to be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9(c).
4. Your Dr. Sana brand Cod Liver Oil and Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the labels fail to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
5. Your Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water product is misbranded within the meaning of 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because the label does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
6. Your Dr. Sana brand Orange Blossom Flower Water product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b). Under section 403(r)(6) of the Act, a dietary supplement may bear certain claims, generally called ""structure/function claims,"" on its label or in its labeling provided that the firm has substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading; the firm has notified FDA within 30 days of marketing the product bearing the claim; and the claim includes a mandatory disclaimer.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be directed to the Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon Hernández, Program Division Director, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact, Ms. Marilyn Santiago, Compliance Officer, at (787) 729-8707 or via email at Marilyn.santiago@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
WL 664804
Dear Mr. Jacquot:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your manufacturing and distributing facility, located at 5514 Langford Ct, Concord, CA 94521, on June 1 through 29, 2023. The inspection revealed significant violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111).
In addition, FDA reviewed the labels for some of your products and the websites www.pacificbiologic.com and www.balanceandharmony.com in July 2023. The review of your labels and websites reveals that claims made for several of your products cause them to be drugs under sections 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Furthermore, several of your products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] because they fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use(s).
At the close of the inspection, on June 29, 2023, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We acknowledge receipt of your response received via email dated July 14, 2023, which included your intended corrections to the observations of concern noted on the form FDA-483. However, the response was not adequate as further described in this letter. Your response targets completion of procedures to establish specifications by(b)(4). Additionally, your response references forms or procedures that were not provided for review. We address your response more specifically below.
Unapproved New Drugs
We reviewed your websites www.pacificbiologic.com and www.balanceandharmony.com and we determined you take orders there for your products ArteClear Circulation 2, Headache Release, Natura-Mune – 2, Pain Release, and Attack 2. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
ArteClear Circulation 2
On your webpage: https://pacificbiologic.com/shop/cardio-heart-health/circulation/
“ArteClear: Circulation 2…cardio-protective ...formula, ischemic heart disease, post heart attack recovery…”
Headache Release
Your product name: “Headache Release”Your Information Panel: “Suggested Dosage ... Reduce the dosage and frequency as the condition improves.”
On your webpage: https://pacificbiologic.com/shop/sleep-stress-anxiety-support/headache-release/• “Non-aspirin”• “If you suffer from frequent headaches or migraines, you know how debilitating they can be. Fortunately, Pacific BioLogic’s Headache Release formula offers natural relief for headaches and migraines.”• “Dosage ... Best taken at the very onset. May be helpful to prevent onset of a migraine if taken at the onset of symptoms.”• “Corydalis”, an ingredient in the product, is listed under “[R]elieve pain and spasms”
Natura-Mune – 2
On your webpage: https://pacificbiologic.com/shop/immune-support/natura-mune/• “This formula is recommended to be included in a supplement support program when treating chronic deficiency-type diseases because of its superior balance and gentle strengthening qualities.”• “Categories: Cold & Flu ... Oncology Support”• “More recently there have been extensive clinical studies that have identified a number of compounds in them [fungi and mushrooms, ingredients in Natura-Mune 2] that ... inhibit bacterial, viral, and tumor growth.• “Cat’s Claw and Pau d’Arcu[sic] [ingredients in Natura-Mune 2] are two well-known (and studied) South American herbs that have some similar properties. They have been used extensively to treat chronic illnesses and degenerative conditions.”• “Suggested Dosage ... Use higher dosage for more severe-immune compromised conditions.
Pain Release
Your product name: “Pain Release”Your Information Panel: “Suggested Dosage: 1 – 4 capsules ... adjusting dosage according to level of pain and trauma”
On your webpage: https://pacificbiologic.com/shop/bone-joint-health/pain-release/• “Regulates body pain and spasms due to trauma, sprains, or fractures. Best if taken during the critical first 24-48 hours after injury.”• “Pacific BioLogic’s Pain Release is a powerful supplement that provides natural support for those who suffer from chronic pain or inflammation. If you are looking for an effective solution to relieve pain and inflammation without resorting to over-the-counter painkillers or prescription medications, Pain Release may be just what you need.”
Attack 2On your webpage: https://pacificbiologic.com/shop/immune-support/attack_2/• [ingredients in the product Attack 2] “... Andrographis, Viola, Chrysanthemum Flower, Oregon Grape Root, and Licorice root. These herbs work well together to cover a very wide spectrum of bacterial and viral strains. Much research has been done on the benefits of Andrographis. Its properties include analgesic, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, expectorant …”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
This is a repeat observation from the Warning Letter issued to you on April 17, 2014, and the items discussed with you in the Regulatory Meeting held on May 19, 2015.
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)]), can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products ArteClear Circulation 2, Natura-Mune – 2, and Attack 2 are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your products listed above fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplement products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulation for dietary supplements (21 CFR Part 111).
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You failed to establish required specifications:
• for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b). Specifically, you failed to establish identity specifications for all components used in the manufacture of your dietary supplements, including ArteClear, Cholesterol, ArteClear Circulation 2, Pain Release, Grounded, and Attack 2.• for dietary supplement labels (label specifications) and for packaging that may come in contact with dietary supplements (packaging specifications), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). Specifically, when asked by the FDA investigator, you stated that you(b)(4)deliver the blended/milled ingredients to your contract manufacturer to encapsulate and bottle the capsules for you as per your verbal instructions.• product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e) for each dietary supplement that you manufacture. Specifically, when asked by the FDA investigator, you stated you do not have finished product specifications for your finished dietary supplement products, including ArteClear Cholesterol, ArteClear, Circulation 2, Pain Release, Grounded, and Attack 2.
Your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, is not adequate because in your response you state that your procedures for establishing identity specifications would be completed by December 2023 but you did not provide any copies of the procedures you mention in your response (such as QA-402 Product Specifications for Identity, Purity, Strength, and Composition, QA-403 Establish Product Specifications for Limits, QA-404 Component Specifications for Purity, Strength, and Composition and QA-405 which you say you intend will establish limits for contamination) or provide any written specifications for your components, packaging, labeling, or finished dietary supplement products.
Once you have established these specifications, you must determine whether the specifications that you establish under 21 CFR 111.70 are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. Specifically, before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Further, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), you must verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). You must also make and keep certain records, including records of the specifications you establish, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95. After establishing the above specifications, you must also collect representative samples of each unique lot of components, packaging and labels that you use to determine whether the components, packaging and labels meet established specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.80(a).
This is a repeat observation from the Warning Letter issued to you on April 17, 2014, and the items discussed with you in the Regulatory Meeting held on May 19, 2015.
2. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, when asked by the FDA investigator to provide specific MMRs, you said you did not have written MMRs for your finished products Headache Release, ArteClear Blood Pressure, and Natura-Mune 2.
The written MMRs that you were able to provide failed to include all of the required information, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your MMRs for ArteClear Cholesterol ArteClear Circulation 2 and Grounded failed to include the following information:• An accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)];• The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d]); A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)];• Written instructions, including the following [21 CFR 111.210(h)]:o Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)];o Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)];o Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR. Such specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i)]; and For manual operations, such specific actions must include [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)]: One person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A)]; and One person adding the component and another person verifying the addition [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B)].• Corrective action plans for use when specifications are not met. [21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)]
Your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, states that you did not fill out the document correctly and that the requirements for your MMRs can be found in document QA-500. We are unable to determine the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide a copy of document QA-500. You also failed to provide MMRs for your finished products Headache Release, ArteClear Blood Pressure, and Natura-Mune 2 and you failed to provide updated MMRs for your finished products ArteClear Cholesterol, ArteClear Circulation 2, and Grounded.
3. You failed to prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). Specifically, you did not prepare a BPR for any of your finished products, including but not limited to Grounded, (Lots 204049, 204023, 204024), Headache Release (Lot 204043), ArteClear Blood Pressure (Lot 204032), Natura-Mune 2 (Lot 204038), ArteClear Cholesterol (Lot 204041), and ArteClear Circulation 2 (Lot 203986), as well as for the products Pain Release, Grounded, and Attack 2.
4. You failed to review all product complaints to determine whether any product complaints involved a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury, as required under 21 CFR 111.560(a)(1). You also failed to make and keep a written record of every product complaint related to good manufacturing practice, as required by 21 CFR 111.570(b)(2). Specifically, during the inspection you stated that you remembered you had your herbal and dietary supplement products returned but that you could not recall when or what herbal and dietary supplement products had been returned.
Your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, states that you have located your file for the Complaint Report Log (QA-301 L), Return Authorization Form, Consumer Complaint Medical Question Form, and Consumer Complaint & Adverse Event Reporting (AER) form; however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide the referenced documents for review.
5. You failed to make and keep records of any material review and disposition decision on a returned dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.535(b)(2). Specifically, during the inspection you stated that you remembered you had your herbal and dietary supplement products returned but you could not recall when or what herbal and dietary supplements were returned.
In your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, you referenced a procedure QA-301, “Returned Merchandise.” You did not provide a copy of this procedure. You did not provide evidence of any material review and deposition of returned dietary supplements.
6. You failed to collect and hold reserve samples of each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements that you distribute, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(a). Specifically, you told an FDA investigator that you do not currently collect and hold reserve samples of the products that you distribute. You stated that you have not collected reserve samples since 2018, and that you no longer collect reserve samples due to a lack of space within your(b)(4).
In your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, you referenced a procedure QA-401, “Collecting and Reserve Samples.” You did not provide a copy of this procedure. You also stated that you will figure out a way to record and label the storage container used for this purpose, but you provided no evidence of your corrective action plan, such as a reserve sample log.
7. Your quality control personnel failed to ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Specifically, the components listed in your master manufacturing records do not match the components listed on the dietary supplement product label. For example:• The MMR for your product Grounded lot #204023 and lot #204024 list the component Inositol NF/FCC; however, Inositol is not listed on the Grounded product label.
We note that the MMR for your product Attack 2 lot #204009 lists the component White Mulberry bark; however, White Mulberry bark is circled by hand, and Andrographis is handwritten beside it. Therefore, it is unclear whether the MMR lists the component White Mulberry bark and Andrographis as being added during manufacturing, or whether the MMR lists Andrographis as being added twice during manufacturing, once on its own, and once to replace the White Mulberry bark component. The product label lists both White Mulberry bark and Andrographis as dietary ingredients in the Attack 2 product.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the Pain Release, Headache Release, ArteClear Circulation 2, and Grounded dietary supplements you manufacture and distribute are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your products Pain Release, and Headache Release, ArteClear Circulation 2, and Grounded are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4(h)(2). For example,
Pain Release• The product label declares “Boswellia resin”, but this is not the common or usual name of the dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, “Frankincense.”• The product label declares “Notoginseng”, but this is not the common or usual name of the dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, “Tienchi Ginseng.”• The standardized common name for Drynaria fortune given in the reference Herbs of Commerce is “drynaria.”• The product label declares “Corydalis”, but this is not the common or usual name of the dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, “Corydalis yanhusuo.”• Your product labels declare “capsules of plant origin”, but this is not a common or usual name for an ingredient.
Headache Release• The product label declares “Citrus viride”, but this is not the common of usual name of the dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, “Tangerine.”• Although the Latin binomial name is declared, it must be placed in parentheses following the standardized common name “Wood Betony.”• The standardized common name for Chrysanthemum x morifolium given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, is “chrysanthemum.”• The product label declares “Pueraria spp.”, but this is not the common of usual name of a dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name given in the reference Herbs of Commerce for the specific species, and in the absence of a standardized common name, the Latin binomial name.• The standardized common name for Gastrodia elata given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, is “Gastrodia.”
ArteClear Circulation 2• The product declares “BioPerine ® (Trademark of Sabinsa Corp.)”, which is a trademarked term and not the common or usual name for the ingredient.
Grounded• “MSM” is not the common or usual name for the ingredient Methylsulfonylmethane.
2. Your products Pain Release, Headache Release, and ArteClear Circulation 2 are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)], in that the labels fail to identity the part of the plant or fail to express the name in English, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example,
Pain Release:• The dietary ingredient “Notoginseng Radix” uses the Latin term “radix” for the plant part. The name must be expressed in English.• The label does not list the plant part for myrrh, sappan wood, and Schefflera arboricola. If the whole or entire plant is used, that information must be listed.
Headache Release:• The label does not list the plant part for Stachys officinalis, Chrysanthemum morifolium, and Uncaria rhynchopylfa. If the entire or whole plant is used, that information must be declared.
ArteClear Circulation 2• The label does not list the plant part for Cayenne pepper.
3. Your products “Pain Release”, “Headache Release”, “ArteClear Circulation 2”, “Natura-Mune 2”, “Attack 2”, “ArteClear Cholesterol”, “ArteClear Blood Pressure” and “Grounded” are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9. For example:
• The title, “Supplement Facts”, should be set to full width of the nutrition label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).• The nutrition information, i.e., the Supplement Facts label, must include the required title, subheadings, usage of heavy and light bars, and hairlines within the box [21 CFR 101.36(e)].• The dietary ingredients comprising the “Proprietary Blend” fail to have hairline rules centered between the lines of text such that the hairline rules separate the dietary ingredients above from the dietary ingredients below, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2) and (e)(5).• Your product labels which do not declare a proprietary blend must bear the quantitative amounts by weight of each other dietary ingredient under the heading “Amount Per Serving”, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).• Your product labels present the nutrition information as per capsule and not on a per serving basis, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(b).• Your product “Headache Release” incorrectly declares the servings per container [21 CFR 101.9(b)(8)].• Your product labels “Pain Release” and “ArteClear Cholesterol” do not declare the components of the “Proprietary Blend” in descending order of predominance by weight, as indicated by the Master Manufacturing Record (MMR) [21 CFR 101.36(c)(2)].
Grounded
• The source of the dietary ingredients, niacin, vitamin B6, magnesium, and zinc must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).• The quantitative amount by weight per serving of the proprietary blend does not use metric measures in appropriate units (i.e., 3000 units must be declared in the next higher set of units, e.g., 6000 mg must be expressed as 6 g), in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A). Furthermore, the dietary ingredients comprising the proprietary blend are not indented under the title “Proprietary Blend”, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).• Potassium must not be listed within the Supplement Facts label because the serving contains less than 2% of the Recommended Daily Intake (RDI), which is considered zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in section 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
4. Your product “Circulation 2” is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) in that the product makes structure/function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b)-(e).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
Regarding your labels• For the product “Grounded” Lithium orotate is misspelled.• For the product “Pain Release”, the dietary ingredient sappanwood should be one word.• For the product “ArteClear Circulation 2”, the standardized common name for Panax ginseng given in the reference Herbs of Commerce is “Oriental ginseng.” However, we would not object to use of “Asian ginseng” as given in the 2nd edition (2000) of Herbs of Commerce.
Regarding your response
In your response to the FDA-483, received on July 14, 2023, you outline your plan to provide all new and updated SOPs by(b)(4).

WARNING LETTER
January 30, 2024
CMS# 666158
Dear Spencer Baird:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, Inmar Supply Chain Solutions, LLC, located at 1131 W Bardin Rd. Ste 131, Arlington, TX 76017 from June 22, 2023 through July 19, 2023. Your facility holds and distributes various human foods; cosmetics; over-the-counter drugs (OTC drugs); and devices. Based on the inspectional findings, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations.
Under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a), the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if such act is done while the products are held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the products being adulterated. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We acknowledge your firm initiated a voluntary recall of certain products regulated by the FDA that were stored and shipped to interstate customers from January 1, 2023 through July 19, 2023 due to the presence of rodents and rodent activity at your firm. At the close of the inspection, you were issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, dated July 19, 2023. FDA received your written responses to those observations on August 10, 2023 and September 11, 2023. We have reviewed your responses and we discuss your significant violations and your corrective actions below.
Adulterated Human Foods
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Foods under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117). These violations cause your human food and dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(3)] in that your products consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food, and within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.
1. You did not exclude pests from your facility to protect against contamination of food, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, our investigators observed evidence of rodent activity, including live rodents, dead rodents in various states of decay, rodent excreta pellets (REP), gnaw marks in food and food packaging, and odors indicative of rodent infestation throughout the entire facility including areas where human food is routinely stored. Further, the following observations were noted by the investigators.
a. Dead rodents along the(b)(4)and in a mechanical trap along the(b)(4).b. Live rodents exiting a box containing chocolate candy and walking across aisle(b)(4).c. Signs of rodent gnawed food products:• Gnawed and spilled meal replacement shakes on Aisle(b)(4)with REP too numerous to count on and under the pallet emitting a foul odor. Flying insects were also observed surrounding the pallet.• Gnawed chocolate candy in a box containing multiple chocolate products.• Gnawed cartons of boxed soup on a pallet of multiple food products located in the aisle adjacent to pallet location(b)(4).• A pallet containing bottled water and a gnawed chocolate bar at pallet location(b)(4).d. Signs of rodent activity and movement observed throughout the facility include:• Rodent tracks in dust on a black plastic trash bag in a tote of household items stored along the(b)(4)in the(b)(4)area adjacent to pallets of soda and bottles of salad dressing.• Rodent tracks in dust on top of a pallet of sparkling water in plastic bottles at pallet location(b)(4).• Paw prints on wooden pallet located at pallet location(b)(4).• Rodent tracks in dust on black plastic totes located at pallet location(b)(4)directly next to a pallet of salad dressing in plastic bottles.e. Ubiquitous presence of rodent excreta pellets (REP) throughout the facility and specifically noted in the following locations:• REPs too numerous to count were observed on and under the pallet of gnawed and spilled meal replacement shakes that were emitting a foul odor.• REPs on the floor on the(b)(4)corner of the warehouse in front of the exterior door.• REPs on the floor at pallet location(b)(4)adjacent to a box containing cheese puff snacks.• REPs too numerous to count along(b)(4)at pallet location(b)(4).• REPs in the(b)(4)corner of the warehouse.• REPs too numerous to count along the(b)(4)near the(b)(4)corner of the warehouse behind pallet location(b)(4).• REP on a plastic wrapped package of bottled sport beverage located at pallet location(b)(4). Small flying insects were also observed around this pallet.• REPs on top of pallets located at(b)(4)with unknown contents.• Apparent rodent hair and REPs too numerous to count at pallet location(b)(4)next to a mechanical trap.f. In addition to visual observations, FDA documented the following findings:• FDA collected several samples during the inspection. These samples included human food products (samples 1220261, 1220262, and 1220263) product packaging, and a filth sample (sample 1220260). These samples were submitted to FDA labs for analysis. FDA’s analysis found the presence of gnaw marks in the packaging, flies and fly body parts, and/or REPs in these samples. Further, the filth sample included REPs collected from locations throughout the facility.• FDA conducted a review of your pest control records between February 15, 2022 and June 26, 2023 which documented the increasing observation of rodents within your facility. During this timeframe, your pest control records document a total of 60 mice and 153 rats being captured. The pest control report dated September 27, 2022 documented the greatest number of mice recovered with 21 mice. Pest control reports dated April 24, 2023 and May 15, 2025 documented the greatest number of rats being captured with a total of 12 for each.
2. You did not maintain your plant in a clean and sanitary condition and in repair adequate to prevent food from becoming adulterated, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Specifically, insanitary conditions were observed around your facility demonstrating that sanitation and housekeeping operations were inadequate. These insanitary conditions are providing food sources and pest harborage areas for rodents and other pests. The following insanitary conditions were observed:
a. Spilled and putrid food product, including gnawed meal replacement shakes, leaking pallets of soda, putrid gnawed oat milk soup (Sample 1220263)b. Opened food and food wrappers in boxes of product. Open chocolate bar observed in a pallet with bottled water located at pallet location(b)(4)c. Three holes in drywall, each approximately 4 inches by 5 inches, were observed in the(b)(4)near the incoming product holding area.d. A large cardboard tote with loose cat food, a towel, and used plastic wrap labeled “Don’t Touch” was observed in pallet location(b)(4). Your firm stated that there was a cat that had kittens in the facility recently. It was later explained that an employee found kittens in the facility about 8 weeks prior.e. Rodent excreta pellets universally throughout the facility
In your responses dated August 10, 2023, and September 11, 2023, you state that you have increased contracted pest control service visits at your facility and provided a copy of your Integrated Pest Management Service Program. You report that there was only one dead mouse catch in the(b)(4)food area in the six weeks post-fumigation. You also state that you have retrained personnel on inspection and rejection standards and increased external inspection and maintenance activities for the facility. We will verify the effectiveness of your corrective actions during our next inspection.
Adulterated Human Drugs
During our June 22 to July 19, 2023 inspection of your facility, investigators from the FDA determined that your firm holds and distributes OTC drug products that are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C.351(a)(2)(B)] in that the building used in the holding of drug products was not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition as required by 21 CFR 211.56(a) and was infested by rodents, insects, and other vermin. The drug products held at your facility were also adulterated under 501(a)(2)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(A)] in that the drug products were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.
During the inspection, our investigator observed filthy conditions in your facility. We observed significant rodent activity throughout the facility. We observed dead rodents in various areas inside your facility, rodent urine and feces around packages containing drug products, and pungent odors in various areas inside your facility. As you are aware, rodents are disease vectors and goods contaminated with rodent feces and/or urine may causeSalmonellaand other infectious diseases. Infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons are at greatest risk for infection and are more likely to have severe symptoms. Consumers can become infected by handling contaminated drugs, including packaging, and then transferring the bacteria from their hands to their mouth. Additionally,Salmonellaon hands or clothes can spread the bacteria to other people, objects, and surfaces.
Products stored at your facility, including adulterated drug products, were shipped to your customers after being held in the above-mentioned conditions. You were aware of a rodent infestation at your facility since at least May 2022, and you continued to ship products, including drug products, to customers up until July 14, 2023, when fumigation of the facility occurred.
In your responses dated August 10, 2023, and September 11, 2023, you state that you have increased contracted pest control service visits at your facility and provided a copy of your Integrated Pest Management Service Program. You also state that you have retrained personnel on inspection and rejection standards and increased external inspection and maintenance activities for the facility. In addition, you note that as part of your process, you destroy any OTC drug products with a compromised consumer package. We will verify the effectiveness of your corrective actions during our next inspection.
Adulterated Devices
Devices have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health, in violation of 501(a)(2)(A) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.
Specifically, the devices held at your facility were exposed to significant rodent infestation. Investigators documented signs of rodent gnawing, live rodents, and apparent rodent like urine and scratches on the pallet of adult diapers and tampons. The conditions described above for foods and drugs reflect the general objectionable conditions of the warehouse under which you also held devices regulated by FDA. Additionally, all products in the facility were exposed to a fumigation process from July 14-17, 2023. Although your responses indicated that the devices exposed to the fumigation were destroyed, the responses did not include actions to be taken for FDA regulated products when exposed to future fumigations.
Your responses dated August 10, 2023, and September 11, 2023, are not adequate. The responses focus on activities conducted at the facility on W. Bradin Road and includes information on why your facility should be considered a Food Storage Facility (ambient temperature). In addition, the supporting documentation, such as the FDA Current Good Manufacturing Practices (Sanitation) procedure, INM.RCD4.01 dated 3/6/2021, addresses sanitation and requirements for food products but does not address specific activities and requirements for medical devices.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to correct any violations and bring the products into compliance. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, FDA offers the following comment:
• We observed boxes of products stored on pallets in a manner that makes inspection and cleaning more difficult. Pallets were stored less than 12 inches from each other in the aisles of pallet racks, which hinders the ability to inspect for pest activity and clean between pallets.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to Chad J. Whitwell, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at the following email: Chad.Whitwell@fda.hhs.gov (preferred) or you may also mail a hard copy addressed to Chad J. Whitwell, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at 1201 Main St, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mr. Whitwell at 214-253-5328 or by email.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Tommy Kerzee:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your food manufacturing facility, located at 2001 Broussard St., Tyler TX 75701 on April 17-21, 2023. Your firm manufactures and repackages, among other food products, ready-to-eat (RTE) seasoning blends. During the inspection, the FDA investigator found serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117). At the conclusion of the inspection, FDA issued a Form FDA 483 (FDA- 483), Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm. Based on FDA’s inspectional findings, we have determined that the ready-to-eat (RTE) seasoning products manufactured in your facility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health. In addition, failure of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a covered facility to comply with the Preventive Controls provisions of the CGMP & PC rule (located in Subparts A, C, D, E, F, and G of Part 117) is prohibited by section 301(uu) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(uu)]. Further, we found significant violations of the labeling regulations for foods, 21 CFR Part 101. These violations cause  your seasoning blends and Dr. Botanical Health products to be misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343).
FDA also reviewed your product labels, product brochure, and website at the Internet address https://drbotanicalhealth.com/. The claims on your product labels, product brochure, and your website establish that certain of your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.On May 3, 2023, FDA received your written response to the Form FDA 483, describing corrective actions taken and planned by your firm. After reviewing the inspectional findings, response that your firm provided, product labeling collected during the inspection, and your website, we are issuing this letter to notify you of FDA’s concerns and provide detailed information describing our findings. We also address your response below.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address https://drbotanicalhealth.com/ in July 2023 and October 2023, and has determined that you take orders there for your Dr. Botanicals Health products Organic Ashwagandha Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Marine Collagen, Organic Cordyceps Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Acai Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Inulin Prebiotic Fiber Superfood Powder, Organic Chaga Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Maca Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Reishi Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, and Organic Rhodiola Rosea Plant Based Superfood Powder.

The claims on your website, product labels, and product brochure establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.

Your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Ashwagandha Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Marine Collagen, Organic Cordyceps Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Acai Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Inulin Prebiotic Fiber Superfood Powder, Organic Chaga Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Maca Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Reishi Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, and Organic Rhodiola Rosea Plant Based Superfood Powder products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be safely used at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Ashwagandha Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Marine Collagen, Organic Acai Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Inulin Prebiotic Fiber Superfood Powder, Organic Chaga Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Maca Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Reishi Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, and Organic Rhodiola Rosea Plant Based Superfood Powder products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Ashwagandha Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Marine Collagen, Organic Acai Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Inulin Prebiotic Fiber Superfood Powder, Organic Chaga Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, Organic Maca Plant Based Superfood Powder, Organic Reishi Mushroom Based Superfood Powder, and Organic Rhodiola Rosea Plant Based Superfood Powder products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (21 CFR Part 117, Subpart C):
1. You did not prepare, or have prepared, and implement a food safety plan, as required by 21 CFR § 117.126(a)(1). The preparation of the food safety plan must be overseen by one or more preventive controls qualified individuals (PCQIs), as required by 21 CFR § 117.126(a)(2). Your food safety plan must also include the following:
1) The written hazard analysis, as required by 21 CFR § 117.130(a)(2);2) The written preventive controls, as required by 21 CFR § 117.135(b);3) The written supply-chain program, as required by Subpart G;4) The written recall plan, as required by 21 CFR § 117.139(a);5) The written procedures for monitoring the implementation of the preventive controls, as required by 21 CFR § 117.145(a);6) The written corrective action procedures, as required by 21 CFR § 117.150(a)(1); and7) The written verification procedures, as required by 21 CFR § 117.165(b).
However, you did not have a food safety plan with any of the required elements. For example, you did not conduct a hazard analysis to identify and evaluate known or reasonably foreseeable hazards for each type of food manufactured, processed, packed, or held at your facility to determine whether there are any hazards requiring a preventive control (see 21 CFR § 117.130(a)). Also, you did not identify and implement preventive controls to provide assurances that any hazards requiring a preventive control will be significantly minimized or prevented and the food manufactured, processed, packed, or held by your facility will not be adulterated under Section 402 of the Act or misbranded under Section 403(w) of the Act (see 21 CFR § 117.135(a)(1)). Preventive controls include, as appropriate to the facility and the food, process controls, food allergen controls, sanitation controls, supply-chain controls, and a recall plan (see 21 CFR § 117.135(c)). Preventive controls are subject to preventive control management components (monitoring, verification, and corrective actions) as appropriate to ensure the effectiveness of the preventive controls, taking into account the nature of the preventive control and its role in the facility's food safety system (see 21 CFR § 117.140). You must also validate that the preventive controls are adequate to control the hazard as appropriate to the nature of the preventive control and its role in the facility’s food safety system (see 21 CFR § 117.160). Specifically:
a. You did not identify and evaluate allergens as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether allergens are a hazard requiring a preventive control. Your facility manufactures RTE seasoning products that contain allergens (such as milk) which are processed using the same utensils on the same production day as products that do not contain milk. Therefore, allergens are a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would identify allergens as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Food allergen controls include procedures, practices, and processes employed for ensuring protection of food from allergen cross-contact (including during storage, handling, and use) and for labeling to ensure that all food allergens required to be stated are included on the label (see 21 CFR § 117.135(c)(2)).
You do not have controls in place for allergen cross-contact or perform and document the review of labels for proper declaration of allergens. For example, you do not identify ingredients used in the seasonings that contain allergens to prevent allergen cross-contact during manufacturing. The John Paine’s Steak Beast Unleashed All Purpose Rub, Net. Wt. 12oz. bears a label that contains an allergen statement that reads in part: “***Contains Dairy.***”; however, the ingredient list for this product did not include butter powder as an ingredient, which contains a major allergen, milk.
b. For your RTE seasoning products, you did not identify and evaluate contamination with environmental pathogens, such asSalmonella, as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether it is hazard requiring a preventive control, to comply with 21 CFR § 117.130(c)(1)(ii). Your facility manufactures RTE seasoning products which are exposed to the environment during blending and filling. The packaged food does not receive any further lethal treatment or otherwise include a control measure (such as a formulation lethal to the pathogen) that would significantly minimize the pathogen. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would identify contamination with environmental pathogens as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Sanitation controls include procedures, practices, and processes to ensure that the facility is maintained in a sanitary condition adequate to significantly minimize or prevent hazards such as environmental pathogens and biological hazards due to employee handling (see 21 CFR § 117.135(c)(3)). In addition, note that environmental monitoring is required if contamination of an RTE food with an environmental pathogen is a hazard requiring a preventive control (see 21 CFR § 117.165(a)(3)).
You do not have appropriate controls in place for contamination with environmental pathogens. You stated that you use Mrs. Meyer’s Clean Day Multi-Surface Concentrate as the main cleaning solution for cleaning all areas of the facility including food-contact surfaces. This is labeled as a household cleaner, not for use on food-contact equipment in a food manufacturing facility. You further stated that you do not use any sanitizers at your facility, such as for food-contact surfaces.
c. You did not identify and evaluate bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether they require a preventive control. Your facility manufactures RTE seasoning products made from onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper and celery powder which have been associated with vegetative bacterial pathogens such asSalmonella. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would identify bacterial pathogens as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Further, a facility that identifies raw materials and other ingredients that require a supply-chain-applied control, such asSalmonella, must establish and implement a risk-based supply-chain program for those raw materials and ingredients (See 21 CFR § 117.405(a)(1)). The supply-chain program must include using approved suppliers and conducting supplier verification activities (see 21 CFR § 117.410).
You do not have an appropriate supply-chain program in place. For example, you do not approve suppliers or conduct appropriate supplier verification activities for the manufacturing of John Paine’s Steak Beast Unleashed All Purpose Rub (Lot: JPUL230216004), which consists of salt, brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, white pepper, black pepper, paprika, cayenne pepper, celery powder, and hickory smoke seasoning.Salmonellain RTE seasoning products is a hazard that can cause serious adverse health consequences or death and thus an annual onsite audit is the appropriate supplier verification activity unless there is a written determination that other verification activities and/or less frequent onsite auditing of the supplier provide adequate assurance that the hazard is controlled (see 21 CFR 117.430(b)). The audit must be conducted before using the raw material or other ingredient from the supplier and at least annually thereafter (see 21 CFR 117.430(b)(1)(ii)).
d. You did not identify and evaluate mycotoxins as a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard to determine whether they require a preventive control. Your facility manufactures and repackages RTE seasoning products made from white pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika. These ingredients have been associated with mycotoxins. A knowledgeable person manufacturing/ processing food in your circumstances would identify mycotoxins as a hazard requiring a preventive control in these ingredients. Further, a facility that identifies raw materials and other ingredients that require a supply-chain-applied control, such as mycotoxins, must establish and implement a risk-based supply-chain program for those raw materials and ingredients (see 21 CFR § 117.405(a)(1)). The supply-chain program must include using approved suppliers and conducting supplier verification activities (see 21 CFR § 117.410). You do not have this program in place.
In your May 3, 2023, response, you included a written contract from a third-party consultant, signed May 1, 2023, to “write and implement your FDA-compliant Food Safety Program for repacking dry spices, herbs, teas and superfoods, train you and assure your operation is fully compliant with all FDA requirements.” The contract also stated, “all FDA-compliant Food Safety Program documentation to be completed within 3 weeks of receiving back a signed proposal, a deposit payment and a completed client intake questionnaire.” We cannot fully evaluate your response because you did not submit the completed food safety program or how you will assure that your facility is compliant with all FDA requirements.
Misbranded Foods
1. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast Unleashed All Purpose Rub product is misbranded within the meaning of 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product label fails to declare the major food allergen “milk” as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act.
Section 201(qq) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(qq)] defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans, and sesame, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients [section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)], or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen) [section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act, 21U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, your Steak Beast Unleashed All Purpose Rub is manufactured using butter powder, which contains milk. However, “milk” is not declared in the ingredient statement, and the “Contains” statement does not declare the common or usual name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived. The term “dairy” is not the appropriate name of the food source that must be used in the “Contains” statement.
2. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast Beasty Bird is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(1)] in that the product label fails to bear the common or usual name of the food. The statement of identity “Beasty Bird” is not provided by law or regulation, is not the common or usual name of a food, and is not appropriately descriptive, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(b).
3. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast Beasty Bird, Chop Beast Pork Rub, Steak Seasoning, and Unleashed All Purpose Rub products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(k)] because the products bear or contain an artificial coloring but do not bear labeling stating that fact. Specifically, the formulation for Chop Beast Pork Rub, Steak Seasoning, and Unleashed All Purpose Rub lists “color – orange” as an ingredient, and the Beasty Bird formulation lists “color – red” as an ingredient. However, none of the product labels declare the artificial color in the ingredient statements. Note that if these color additives are certified, they must be declared in accordance with the 21 CFR 74, Listing of Color Additives Subject to Certification.
4. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast Beasty Bird, Unleashed All Purpose Rub, Steak Seasoning, and Pork Rub products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the products are fabricated from two or more ingredients and each ingredient is not declared on the label in descending order of predominance by weight in the finished food. Specifically,a. Your Beasty Bird formulation indicates “brownulated (sic) sugar” is the predominant ingredient; however, the ingredient statement on the product label declares salt as the first ingredient. According to 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1), ingredients shall be listed by their common or usual name in descending order of predominance by weight. The formulation also lists the following ingredients that are not declared on the label: celery salt (the label only lists “celery”), white pepper, cayenne pepper, and hot paprika.b. Your Unleashed All Purpose Rub formulation lists butter powder as an ingredient; however, this ingredient is not declared on the label, as required by 21 CFR 101.4. Additionally, the Unleashed All Purpose Rub formulation indicates the product is made from one part Unleashed and two parts Steak Beast Original seasoning, which also includes the following ingredients that are not declared on the Unleashed All Purpose Rub label: sugar (only ""brown sugar” is declared on the label), black pepper, white pepper, cayenne pepper (the label only lists “pepper”), and celery salt.c. Your Steak Beast Steak Seasoning formulation includes the following ingredients that are not declared on the product label: celery salt (as the label only lists “celery”), white pepper, and cayenne pepper. Note that the formulation does not include onion powder, but the label declares onion powder.d. Your Chop Beast Pork Rub formulation includes the following ingredients that are not declared on the product label: celery salt (the label only lists “celery”), and white pepper.e. Your Beasty Bird, Unleashed All Purpose Rub, Steak Beast Steak Seasoning, and Chop Beast Pork Rub formulations include celery salt as an ingredient. If celery salt is a multi-component ingredient, each ingredient of the celery salt must also be declared.
5. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast Beasty Bird, Chop Beast Pork Rub, Steak Seasoning, and Unleashed All Purpose Rub products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] in that they fail to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5
6. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast products (Beasty Bird, Chop Beast Pork Rub, Steak Seasoning, Unleashed All Purpose Rub), and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] in that the nutrition information (e.g., Nutrition Facts label, “NFL”) is not in accordance with the requirements under 21 CFR 101.9. Specifically,a. The nutrients declared in the NFLs are not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c). For example:i. The NFLs on the John Paine’s Steak Beast products do not include the following required information: Total Sugars (rather than Sugars), Added Sugars, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c).ii. The NFLs on the Dr. Botanical Health products do not include Sodium, Total Carbohydrates, Dietary Fiber, Total Sugars, Added Sugars, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c).b. The NFL format is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(d). For example:i. The labels on the John Paine’s products use a footnote not provided for in 21 CFR 101.9(d)(9).ii. The declaration of Calories from Fat on the John Paine’s product labels is no longer permitted in the updated NFL.iii. The heading “Nutrition Facts Per 12 oz (340g)” on the John Paine’s product labels is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(2).iv. The heading “Nutrition Facts Per 100g Bag” on the Dr. Botanical Health product labels is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(d)(2).v. The John Paine’s product labels declare a “Servings Per Package” of 227 servings, a serving size of “¼ tsp (5g),” and net quantity of contents of “12oz (340g).” The information in the NFL appears to be incorrect because 227 x 5g servings equates to 1,135g, which does not equal the net quantity of contents declared on the label.c. The NFLs of the Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder include the ingredient statements. The NFL requirements under 21 CFR 101.9 does not provide for the inclusion of the ingredient statements. The ingredient statements must be separately declared on the principal display panel (PDP) or the information panel, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4.d. The Calories declarations on both the Dr. Botanical Health products are not expressed in the appropriate units and/or increments as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c). Additionally, the Organic Lion’s Mane Carbohydrates declaration is also not expressed in the appropriate units and/or increments.e. The Dr. Botanical Health product labels fail to list the percent daily values (%DV), as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c).
7. Your John Paine’s Steak Beast products (Beasty Bird, Chop Beast Pork Rub, Steak Seasoning, and Unleashed All Purpose Rub) are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the labels fail to declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(a).
8. Even if your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder products were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, they are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product labels bear nutrient content claims, but the products do not meet the requirements to bear such claims. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of the food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act.
Specifically, your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder products bear the claim “Powerful Antioxidant.” Nutrient content claims using the term “antioxidant” must comply with, among other requirements, the requirements listed in 21 CFR 101.54(g). These requirements state, in part, that for a product to bear such a claim, a reference daily intake (RDI) must have been established for each of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim [21 CFR 101.54(g)(1)], and these nutrients must have recognized antioxidant activity [21 CFR 101.54(g)(2)]. The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must also be sufficient to qualify for the claim under 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e), as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(3). In addition, such a claim must include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim as part of the claim or, alternatively, the term “antioxidant” or “antioxidants” may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of the product label, followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity [21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)].
Your claim “Powerful Antioxidant” does not include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim, or link the nutrients with the claim by use of a symbol.
Your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder also bears the nutrient content claim “Rich in Vitamins & Nutrients,” but the product does meet the requirements to bear the claim. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.54(b), the terms “rich in,” “high,” or “excellent source of” may be used to characterize the level of a nutrient on the label and in the labeling of foods, provided that the food contains 20 percent or more of the RDI or Daily Reference Value (DRV) per reference amount customarily consumed. However, your product label does not list any vitamins and does not specify which nutrients the product is “rich in.”
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also have the following comments on your Dr. Botanical Health products:
Your Dr. Botanical Health Organic Elderberry Plant Based Superfood Powder and Dr. Botanical Health Organic Lion’s Mane Mushroom Based Superfood Powder products are marketed as conventional foods. For example, you have included a “Nutrition Facts” panel on the product labels. However, these labels also contain the statement, “Statements regarding dietary supplement have not been evaluated by the FDA and are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent and [sic] disease or health condition.” To the extent you intend these products to be conventional foods, you should not refer to them as dietary supplements. We note that, under section 201(ff)(2)(B) of the Act, a dietary supplement “means a product that . . . is not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet.”
For your Dr. Botanical Health product labels, the provisions in 21 CFR 101.7(j)(3) state that the term “net weight” must be used when stating the net quantity of contents in terms of weight. In addition, the regulation does not provide for the term “servings” as part of the net quantity of contents statement.
The statement of the place of business must include the street address, city, State, and ZIP code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory. 21 CFR 101.5(d). Please note that the regulation does not provide for the use of PO Box in lieu of a street address.
We note that the product labels for your Dr. Botanical Health products bear the disclaimer, “May be packaged in a facility that also packs nuts.” Advisory labeling is not a substitute for adherence to current good manufacturing practices and, when used by a facility, food allergen preventive controls. See Questions and Answers
Regarding Food Allergens, Including the Food Allergen Labeling Requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (Edition 5): Guidance for Industry. The firm should make every effort to ensure that they and their suppliers have adequate GMP's in place to prevent the unintentional inclusion of allergens in their products and ingredients.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to René R. Ramirez, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration One Main Place, 1201 Main Street, STE 7200, Dallas, TX 75202, or via email at rene.ramirez@fda.hhs.gov.

RE: 662503
Dear Mr. Jassy:
This letter concerns your firm’s distribution of products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”). The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) purchased on your website, www.amazon.com, products that are labeled as energy enhancing supplements or food, but laboratory analyses confirmed that they contained undeclared and potentially harmful active pharmaceutical ingredients. As discussed further below, your firm is responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce products that are unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, the products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a). Your firm is also responsible for introducing or delivering for introduction into interstate commerce a food that is prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
FDA purchased “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” through your website, www.amazon.com. All of these products were introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by Amazon via your Fulfillment by Amazon service.1FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that the “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “Genergy,” and “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” products, purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) tadalafil; and the “WeFun,”2“Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products, also purchased on www.amazon.com, contained the API sildenafil. These ingredients are not declared on the products’ labeling.3Sildenafil and tadalafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Viagra and Cialis, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels.
Information on the labels and/or labeling of “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” demonstrates that these products are marketed as dietary supplements4. However, these products do not meet the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). Under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a product is not a dietary supplement if it includes an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act, unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. Sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003. Given that sildenafil and tadalafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as foods before Viagra and Cialis were FDA-approved, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain sildenafil or tadalafil, are excluded from the definition of “dietary supplement” under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
The remaining product, “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey,” is a food5that was confirmed by laboratory analysis to contain tadalafil.
Unapproved New Drugs
The “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” products that are marketed as dietary supplements are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on the labeling, including the outer packaging, that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“MANNERS Energy Boost”From the product label:
“Energy Boost”
“Round 2”From the product label:
“THE POWER TO GO AGAIN! STRENGTH * ENERGY * ENDURANCE”
“WeFun”From the product label:
“Energy[,] Performance”
“Genergy”From the product label:
“ENERGY FOR MEN”
“Big Guys Male Energy Supplement”From the product label:
From the product name: “Male Energy Supplement”
“Extreme Power”
“Focus . . . Energy . . . Mood”
“500 MG POWER BOOST”
“Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”From the product label:
The product name: “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement”
“NEVER ENDING ENERGY!”
“STRENGTH[,] ENERGY[,] ENDURANCE”
“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without approved applications violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Misbranded Drugs
Additionally, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for these products does not declare that they contain PDE-5 inhibitors. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in these products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the products’ labeling renders them misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
“MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended uses. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement,” which contain undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil, are also prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, and as such, can be used safely only at the direction and under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” such that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended uses. These products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there are no FDA-approved applications in effect for these products. For these reasons, “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared sildenafil or tadalafil in “MANNERS Energy Boost,” “Round 2,” “WeFun,” “Genergy,” “Big Guys Male Energy Supplement,” and “Mens Maximum Energy Supplement” also causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings against unsafe dosage or methods or duration of administration or application, in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes these products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for the associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Prohibited Act under Section 301(ll)
It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. As noted above, FDA purchased “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” from www.amazon.com and confirmed through laboratory testing that the product contained undeclared tadalafil. Based on available evidence, FDA has determined that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to tadalafil.6The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of “X Max Triple Shot Energy Honey” is therefore prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of past or present violations that may exist in connection with the products you distribute. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction. Please submit a written response to this letter within fifteen working days from the date of receipt, explaining the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, including steps you will take to ensure that Amazon will no longer introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded products with undeclared drug ingredients, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that the products you distribute are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within fifteen working days from the date of receipt of this letter.

RE: 664359
Dear Daniel Zeng:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, https://www.eshoponlineusa.com, from July to December 2023, where you take orders for “WeFun.”1In addition, FDA has obtained a sample and labeling of your “WeFun” product. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “WeFun” is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “WeFun” product contains the undeclared pharmaceutical ingredient sildenafil. Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates.
Information on the label and labeling of your “WeFun” product demonstrates that this product is marketed as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that sildenafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Viagra was approved, your “WeFun” product is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “WeFun” product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website and product labels that establish the intended use of your “WeFun” product as a drug include, but are not limited to, the following:
On the “WeFun” label:
“ENERGY”
“PERFORMANCE”
On your webpage, https://eshoponlineusa.com/collections/frontpage/products/we-fun-natural-make-energy-supplement-amplifier-for-strength-performance-energy-and-endurance-fast-acting-10-gold-capsules:
“WeFun Natural Male Energy Supplement, Amplifier for Strength, Performance, Energy, and Endurance”
Your “WeFun” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for “WeFun.” Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drug
Your “WeFun” product is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the method of their use, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Your “WeFun” product, which contains undeclared sildenafil, is a prescription drug as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), and as such, can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for your “WeFun” product such that a layperson can use the drug safely for its intended uses. “WeFun” is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling bears adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA approved application in effect for this product. For these reasons, your “WeFun” product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
Additionally, your “WeFun” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “We Fun” does not declare that the product contains a PDE-5 inhibitor. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitor in your “WeFun” product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the product without knowing that it can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the product labeling renders your “WeFun” product misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient in your product also causes this product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because its labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for serious health risks associated with this product, particularly since anyone who takes your “WeFun” product would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredient and placed at risk for its associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
We also documented that your website, https://www.eshoponlineusa.com/, offers for sale variations of “BLACK ANT KING,” “BIGGER LONGER,” “Germany Black Gorilla” and/or various Rhino products for sale to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA lab analyses of products similarly named to those sold on your websites revealed these products contained the undeclared ingredients sildenafil and/or tadalafil.2We also note that you offer for sale the product “Royal Honey” on your website. A variation of this product with the same name has been the subject of previous FDA warnings after FDA analysis confirmed the presence of an undeclared PDE-5 inhibitor.3While the Agency has not sampled and tested these product variations from your inventory to date, this letter is to express our serious concern about the safety of these products and emphasize that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that they do not contain any undeclared and potentially harmful ingredients.
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with the products you distribute. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

December 21, 2023
RE: 671066
Dear Mr. Felix:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://botanical-be.com/ in July 2023, where you take orders for “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” products. In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of your “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” products. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” contains undeclared diclofenac. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (commonly referred to as NSAIDs). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. This hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Information on the label and/or labeling of “Kuka Flex Forte” and “Reumo Flex” demonstrates that the products are marketed as dietary supplements.1Under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), if an article is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.
FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as food before Voltaren was approved, “Kuka Flex Forte” and “Reumo Flex,” which contain diclofenac, are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims from the product labeling, including on your website https://botanical-be.com/, that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Kuka Flex Forte:• “[P]owerful anti-inflammatory properties, effectively relieving arthritic and muscular pain.”• “[P]reventing the formation of antigens that can trigger rheumatic and arthritic conditions. . . . aids in reducing inflammation and pain.”• “Considered one of the most potent natural anti-inflammatories, it is highly beneficial for arthritis, gout, rheumatism and other joint-related ailments.”• “[I]t has analgesic (pain-relieving) and antirheumatic properties. . . . effective option for combating arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and even osteoarthritis.""
Reumo Flex:• “RELIEVE Joint Pain Arthritis & Ciatica [sic]”• “For JointsAnd for Arthritis and Sciatica Pain”
Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3:• “Formula 100% Efectiva Contra El Dolor” (English translation: 100% Effective Formula Against Pain)• “Artri King Ortiga/Omega 3/CurcumaIt’s [sic] really really help[s] way better than a gout medicine artri king”• “Artri King Ortiga/Omega 3/CurcumaVery effective, my husband and my father-in-law took it in 2 days and saw positive changes in their arthritic pain.""
“Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3.” Accordingly, introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d), 21 U.S.C. 331(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act.
Misbranded Drug
Your “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” products are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex”, and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” does not declare that the products contain the drug ingredient diclofenac. As discussed earlier, diclofenac can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, or serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines, or liver toxicity including liver failure that can cause the need for a liver transplant or death. The failure to disclose the presence of diclofenac in the products’ labeling renders “Kuka Flex Forte,” “Reumo Flex,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

RE: # 656057
Dear Alaa Odeh Mahmoud Hamed and Abdulraouf B. Allamandani:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://hemp-xr.com/ in September 2023 and has determined that you take orders there for various products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or cannabidiol (CBD).
FDA has determined that your Far Out Candy 500MG Delta 8 Cookies, Not Ya Son’s Weed Bakedies Delta 8 THC 600MG Crispy Bites, Hemp XR Delta 8 Stoner Candy Gummies (including Crawlers, Fruit Smashers, Magic Marbles, and Stoney Headz Sour), Lava Rocks 250 MG Delta 8, Delta 8 Rainbow Rope, Pharma Delta 8 Gummies, Hemp XR Delta 8 Honey 500 MG, and Hemp XR CBD Honey 500 MG products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your Hemp XR CBD Honey 500 MG product into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD-containing products. FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Far Out Candy 500MG Delta 8 Cookies, Not Ya Son’s Weed Bakedies Delta 8 THC 600MG Crispy Bites, Hemp XR Delta 8 Stoner Candy Gummies (including Crawlers, Fruit Smashers, Magic Marbles, and Stoney Headz Sour), Lava Rocks 250 MG Delta 8, Delta 8 Rainbow Rope, Pharma Delta 8 Gummies, and Hemp XR Delta 8 Honey 500 MG products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Far Out Candy 500MG Delta 8 Cookies, Not Ya Son’s Weed Bakedies Delta 8 THC 600MG Crispy Bites, Hemp XR Delta 8 Stoner Candy Gummies (including Crawlers, Fruit Smashers, Magic Marbles, and Stoney Headz Sour), Lava Rocks 250 MG Delta 8, Delta 8 Rainbow Rope, Pharma Delta 8 Gummies, and Hemp XR Delta 8 Honey 500 MG are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Furthermore, according to your product labeling, your Hemp XR CBD Honey 500 MG is a food to which CBD has been added.
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Hemp XR CBD Honey 500 MG product is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because it bears or contains an unsafe food additive. Introduction of this adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
As stated above, according to your product labeling, your Hemp XR CBD Honey 500 MG product is a food to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to the United States Food and Drug Administration at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 656057” in the subject line of your email.

1Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
2CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

RE: 661488
Dear Justin L. Hays:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at https://discovercbd.com/ and https://www.activecbdoil.com from June to August 2023. We note that your firm is the U.S. distributor for the Active CBD Oil brand of various products, which you represent contain cannabidiol (CBD), cannabigerol (CBG), hexahydrocannabinol (HHC), and Delta-8 Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).1Your website, www.activecbdoil.com provides a direct link to the website, www.discovercbd.com where consumers can purchase the Active CBD Oil brand of products.2The claims on your website, https://discovercbd.com establish that your products, “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum Distillate Cartridge,” “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum CBD Salve,” “Strain Snobs- 99% Pure CBD Isolate powder,” “Active CBD Oil-CBD Lotion,” “CBG Isolate Powder,” “HHC Cartridge- OG Kush,” and “Strain Snobs Δ8 THC Salve,” are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). In addition, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1) and sold in violation of 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1) and 331(a).
FDA has also determined that your “Active CBD Oil Infused Coffee,” “Active CBD Oil Gummies,” “CBD Living Water,” and “Strain Snobs™ Delta-8 Plant-Based Gummies” products offered for sale on your webpages, https://www.activecbdoil.com/1, https://discovercbd.com/, and https://strainsnobs.com are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Active CBD Oil Infused Coffee,” “Active CBD Oil Gummies,” “CBD Living Water,” and “Strain Snobs™ Delta-8 Plant-Based Gummies” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll). Consumers may confuse these products with traditional foods; therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of CBD and Delta-8 THC.
In addition, the claims on your website, https://discovercbd.com/ and your social media webpage, https://www.instagram.com/discovercbd, establish that your “Active CBD Oil Savory Pumpkin Treats,” “Active CBD Oil 120mg CBD Pet Tincture – Bacon,” and “Active CBD Oil 300mg CBD Broad Spectrum – Chicken” products, which you offer for sale as products containing CBD for use in animals, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and are adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Furthermore, these products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Additionally, it is a prohibited act to introduce these products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.

Unapproved New Drugs
Based on a review of your websites, your “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum Distillate Cartridge,” “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum CBD Salve,” “Strain Snobs- 99% Pure CBD Isolate powder,” “Active CBD Oil-CBD Lotion,” “CBG Isolate Powder,” “HHC Cartridge- OG Kush,” and “Strain Snobs Δ8 THC Salve” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your website https://discovercbd.com that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your “CBD and Breast Cancer” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/cbd-and-breast-cancer:
“The American Association for Cancer Research published a study on how CBD may be able to induce cell death in breast cancer cells. The study suggested that CBD played in [sic] a role in the coordination of apoptosis and autophagy. The coordination of apoptosis and autophagy can help to target breast cancer cells and causes programmed cancer cell death. . . . Most antineoplastic agents used today have side effects that can damage other parts of the body and healthy cells. Because there are no known major negative side effects to using CBD, the interest in CBD as a possible treatment for breast cancer continues to grow.”
“A study done in Italy . . . suggested that out of all the cannabinoids, CBD was the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth.”
On your “CBD for Kids: Answering FAQ’s” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/cbd-and-kids-answering-faqs
“CBD has also been scientifically shown to treat is [sic] epilepsy. There have been many clinical studies done on how CBD may help kids with epilepsy with great results . . . If your child struggles with ADD/ADHD they may also benefit from CBD as it has been shown to be potentially effective with helping hyperactivity.”
On your “5 Little known benefits of CBD” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/5-little-known-benefits-of-cbd:
“Studies have proved that CBD can help in PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) treatment . . . CBD provides a calming effect that has antipsychotic benefits hence providing a stable mental environment for people trying to recover from . . . PTSD.”
“Did you know that over 400 million people globally suffer from Diabetes resulting in close to 5 million deaths annually? Substantial scientific evidence concludes that CBD could come in handy in preventing and managing this chronic ailment.”
“Reliable studies have proved that cannabis is likely help control insulin levels by lowering insulin resistance.”
On your “What is CBG? Webpage in the FAQ section https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/what-is-cbg:
“It has been shown to reduce intraocular pressure, which is important in the treatment of glaucoma. In studies on breast and skin cancer, it has shown anti-recurrence properties.”
On your “Strain Snobs Delta 8 THC Dab Review” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/strain-snobs-delta-8-dab-review:
“Another good thing about the delta 8 THC Dabs by Strain Snobs is that it can be used to make concentrates at home if you have a decent dab rig. The company says that the extract has been sent to the lab for testing and according to TMMR, this extract was tested three times in order to ensure its quality. All these tests showed positive results which means that delta 8 THC dabs are top notch grade products that are meant to provide . . . cancer treatment etc.”
On your “Delta 8 for Sleep Better Than the Dead” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/delta-8-thc-and-cbn-for-sleep:
“Delta 8 is a non-psychoactive cannabinoid compound that helps . . . reduce seizures. Delta 8 THC is also known to assist in helping treat cancer . . .”
On your “HHC vs Delta 8: What’s the Difference” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/hhc-vs-delta-8:
“HHC is an anti-depressant that has been proven effective in all areas, from anxiety reduction to euphoria and sedation.”
On your “CBD & Opioid Addiction” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/cbd-helpful-for-addicts:
An image that includes text such as, “addiction,” “drug abuse,” “psychological symptoms,” “physiological dependence,” and “mental disorder”
“So, how does CBD help with addiction? Researchers have found that CBD can help block these associations through the serotonin system. The serotonin system is usually associated with mood, but it's also associated with addiction. The CBD interacts with the serotonin system to block opioid reward-seeking behavior showing a reduction in adverse side effects.”
“Although there hasn't been a lot of research with CBD in the field of addiction, all signs point toward more studies being done to try to find the answers and help bring an end to the opioid epidemic. With over 60,000 deaths in 2016 we desperately need something to help, and CBD may just be the answer.”
On your “Post-Acute Withdrawal Syndrome: Could CBD be the Silver Bullet?” webpage https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/tagged/treatment:
“CBD presents an astounding array of potential benefits to those in recovery from addiction: alleviating symptoms associated with post-acute withdrawals, managing triggers, and helping individuals cease behaviors that predict relapse . . . If you are in recovery from addiction, and in light of all the evidence supporting the use of CBD to assist in the recovery process, why wouldn’t you add CBD to your toolkit?”
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving the opioid crisis.3You market your CBD products for the treatment or cure of opioid addiction and withdrawal symptoms. However, these products have not been determined by FDA to be safe and effective for these (or any other) uses. Further, the unproven treatments could cause patients to forego or delay FDA-approved treatments for opioid addiction or withdrawal. The marketing and sale of unapproved opioid addiction treatment products is a potentially significant threat to the public health. Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect consumers from products that, without approval by FDA, claim to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, treat or cure opioid addiction.
Your “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum Distillate Cartridge,” “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum CBD Salve,” “Strain Snobs- 99% Pure CBD Isolate powder,” “Active CBD Oil-CBD Lotion,” “CBG Isolate Powder,” “HHC Cartridge- OG Kush,” and “Strain Snobs Δ8 THC Salve” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum Distillate Cartridge,” “Active CBD Oil – Full Spectrum CBD Salve,” “Strain Snobs- 99% Pure CBD Isolate powder,” “Active CBD Oil-CBD Lotion,” “CBG Isolate Powder,” “HHC Cartridge- OG Kush,” and “Strain Snobs Δ8 THC Salve” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) Your products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for these products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your “Active CBD Oil – CBD Infused Coffee,” “Active CBD Oil Gummies” and “CBD Living Water” products are foods to which CBD has been added.
We note that your various strengths of “Active CBD Oil Gummies” products appear to be promoted as a conventional human food. Specifically, you promote these gummies as “delicious, fruity candy.” It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.4
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “Active CBD Oil Gummies,” “Active CBD Oil – CBD Infused Coffee,” and “CBD Living Water” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, according to your product labeling, your “Strain Snobs™ Delta 8 Plant-Based Gummies” product is food to which Delta-8 THC has been added. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods.
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your product does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Strain Snobs™ Delta 8 Plant-Based Gummies” product is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because it bears or contains an unsafe food additive. Introduction of this adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website https://discovercbd.com/, and your social media webpage https://www.instagram.com/discovercbd, FDA has determined that your firm offers for sale the unapproved new animal drugs “Active CBD Oil Savory Pumpkin Treats,” “Active CBD Oil 120mg CBD Pet Tincture – Bacon,” and “Active CBD Oil 300mg CBD Broad Spectrum – Chicken.” Based on our review of your website and social media webpage, these CBD-containing products for animals are drugs under section 201(g)(1)of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims from your website and social media webpage that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as animal drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your “CBD for Pets For Sale” webpage, https://discovercbd.com/collections/pets, under the heading “The Benefits of CBD Oil for Pets”:
“Lowers Anxiety”
“Reduces Pain . . . CBD promotes anti-inflammatory properties . . .”
“Helps With Seizures ”
On your “CBD Oil for Dogs” webpage, https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/cbd-oil-for-dogs:
“CBD may be an option for dogs dealing with issues, such as, inflammatory problems, seizures, pain, and anxiety.”
“CBD has been extensively researched as a cancer-fighting substance. Studies have shown CBD may slow the growth of cancer causing tumors. CBD has also been known to kill cancer cells by blocking their ability to produce energy. CBD oil may also be helpful for nausea that comes along with many cancer treatments , as it’s known to be an excellent anti-nausea med. Studies have also shown that it may significantly reduce cancer-related pain as well.”
“Researchers at Colorado State University got excited when they studied CBD as an option for treatment in dogs with epilepsy. The results are astounding! 89% of dogs that received CBD had a reduction in their seizures. CBD may reduce the frequency and severity of seizures . . . ”
“Anxiety is a common reason why dog owners turn to CBD. Anxiety in dogs can appear in many different ways, such as, noise phobia, separation anxiety, aggression, and fear.”
“CBD can be used internally for allergies, or externally for more hot spots.”
On your “CBD For Cats! Making Life Easier For Your Feline Companion” webpage, https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/cbd-for-cats-making-life-easier-for-your-feline-companion:
“Whether they suffer from stress disorders, hyperactivity, adventure-related injuries, or joint pain from old age, CBD may be a wonderful addition to their daily diet. “
“By giving Bonsai daily doses of CBD with her meals, we have completely eliminated her destructive nervous habit and she seems happier and more calm in general.”
“CBD can have anti-inflammatory and analgesic painkilling properties, without the negative sedative effects of heavy pharmaceutical painkillers . . . ”
On your March 15, 2023, Instagram post found on your social media webpage www.instagram.com/discovercbd:
“I rescued Charlie from a shelter when he was 10. Shortly after, due to the natural aging process he began developing arthritis. . . the moment he tried DiscoverCBD’s 300mg Chicken Tincture we never looked back. Thanks to this product Charlie is able to go for walks, get in and out of the car with ease, conquer stairs like a champion, and has little to no separation anxiety! An added bonus is he’s much calmer during loud holidays such as the fourth of July!”
Your CBD-containing products for animals are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, your “Active CBD Oil Savory Pumpkin Treats,” “Active CBD Oil 120mg CBD Pet Tincture – Bacon,” and “Active CBD Oil 300mg CBD Broad Spectrum – Chicken” products are animal foods to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your product labeling refers to your “Active CBD Oil Savory Pumpkin Treats” product as “treats.” Additionally, your CBD products for animals claim to have nutritional value for dogs. For example, your “Will CBD Oil Work For My Dog?” webpage,https://discovercbd.com/blogs/cbd-news/94865734-can-cbd-oil-work-for-my-dog, states, “A compelling reason for considering CBD oil for your dog is for the nutritional value it delivers . . . A daily dose or two of CDB oil for pets can help satisfy a dog’s dietary requirements.” Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.5
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal food. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal food are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “Active CBD Oil Savory Pumpkin Treats,” “Active CBD Oil 120mg CBD Pet Tincture – Bacon,” and “Active CBD Oil 300mg CBD Broad Spectrum – Chicken,” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated animal foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We offer the following additional comments:
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://discovercbd.com indicates that you intend to market your CBD products “Active CBD Oil Capsules Gold Label Hemp Supplement,” “Active CBD Oil Full Spectrum CBD Capsules,” and “Active CBD Oil Tinctures (1250-2500 mg)” as dietary supplements. The product webpages display an image of these products with a Supplement Facts panel. Your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.6There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, CDER/OC/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by email to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

1FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: (1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that puts public health at risk; (2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; (3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; (4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and (5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter informs you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.

For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTERCMS # 659048
October 18, 2023Dear Mr. Ashraf:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 901 State Route 541 Coshocton, OH 43812-9769 from March 14, 2023- April 14, 2023. Based on our inspection, subsequent review of product labeling collected during the inspection, and review of your firm’s website, www.natrelief.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website, www.natrelief.com in June 2023 and determined that you take orders for Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11. The claims on your website, establish that your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On the product webpage for Edema NatRelief 6:
“Edema NatRelief…” [Product name]
“Helps relieve mild joint inflammation and swelling”
On the product webpage for BP NatRelief 11:
“Coriander seed have been actively investigated for their chemical composition and biological activities including antimicrobial, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic, anxiolytic, analgesic, anti- inflammatory, anti-convulsant and anti-cancer activities *. The seeds of coriander also have a remarkable hypolipidemic action. The levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides decreased significantly….”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product BP NatRelief 11 is intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, BP NatRelief 11 fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Even if your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 products were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act. The facility inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The violations include the following:
1. You failed to establish specifications for points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, regarding your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products:
a. For your components:
i. You failed to establish identity specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). For example, the ammonium chloride salt ingredient used in your Edema NatRelief 6 product and the Rauwolfia Root used in your BP NatRelief 11 product list organoleptic testing (color, odor, flavor, shape, and extraneous matters) to determine identity. Organoleptic analysis may not be an appropriate method of testing for certain substances. This is particularly true when the nature of the substance, for example powdered substances, decreases the reliability of organoleptic analysis. In addition, Rauwolfia Root may require(b)(4)examinations, such as(b)(4)examination of the(b)(4)to confirm its identity in addition to the bitter taste. The Rauwolfia Root may have a characteristic bitter taste; however, other plants/plant roots have bitter taste as well.
ii. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement manufactured using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, the component specifications you provided to our Investigator for the ammonium chloride salt used in the manufacture of your Edema NatRelief 6 product includes specifications for color, odor, flavor, and shape. The record does not contain specifications for(b)(4)analysis; based on the nature of the substance, that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement using the component is met.
iii. You failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).
b. You failed to establish in-process specifications for any point, step, or stage in the master manufacturing record where control is necessary to help ensure that specifications are met for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(c)(1). During the manufacture of the BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 dietary supplements there is a(b)(4)operation of the product blend. You state the(b)(4)step is performed until the desired particle size is reached; however, you have not established an in-process specifications for particle size.
c. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminants that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have not established finished product specifications for the BPNatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 dietary supplement products.
Once you have established the specifications identified above, you must verify that the specifications are met in accordance 21 CFR 111.75.
We have reviewed your response dated May 5, 2023, and we are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you have not provided revised “Raw Materials Spec Sheet” for the components used in the manufacture of the BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 dietary supplements, nor have you provided finished product specifications for each of the products.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing for your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, you provided a copy of the following documents “Approval Matrix and Review Period of Quality Documents,” “Responsibilities for Authorizing Master File Documents,” “Document Retention Times and Responsible Persons (All Documents),” and “Document Database for Quality Document.” The documents do not describe the responsibilities of your quality control personnel or operations. Further, they do not describe how your quality personnel conduct material reviews, how they make disposition decisions, or how they approve or reject any reprocessing.
Further, once you have established written quality control procedures, you must implement quality control operations in your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.65.
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. Your response states a third-party consultant has been hired who will perform a gap analysis of all your processes, including quality control operations. You also state that the identified documents and procedures will be created. However, we are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you did not provide copies of your established written procedures for the responsibilities of your quality control operations for review.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch for your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a) and 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your master manufacturing record titled “Master Formula” is not prepared for a unique dietary supplement formulation and batch size.
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. Your response states MMRs will be reviewed and revised. However, we are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you did not provide your revised master manufacturing record for review.
4. You failed to establish a batch production record (BPR) that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 111.255 and 111.260. For example, the BPRs for the BP Nat Relief, 11 Lot(b)(4), and Edema NatRelief 6, Lot(b)(4)you provided to our Investigator were missing:
A statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing as required by 21 CFR 111.260(f). Specifically, a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield was not established at the(b)(4)phase, and the finished dietary supplement packaging, and labeling phases for your dietary supplements.
An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the MMR, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(k)(2).
Unique identifier assigned to packaging and labels used, as required by 21 CFR 111.260 (k)(1).
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. Your response states you will be revising associated MMRs with the referenced BPRs. However, we are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you did not provide your revised batch production record for review.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, you have not established written procedures for holding and distributing operations for your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products. Once you have established written procedures for your holding and distributing operations, you must make and keep records of such written procedures, as required by 21 CFR 111.475(b)(1).
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. Your response states a third-party consultant has been hired who will analyze your firm’s operations. After this analysis, the appropriate documents and procedures will be created, including procedures related to the holding and distribution of dietary supplement products. No evidence of these corrective actions were provided.
6. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for returned dietary supplements for your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products, as required by 21 CFR 111.503. Specifically, you have no written procedures for returned dietary supplements.
Once have you established written procedures for your returned dietary supplements, you must make and keep records, as required by 21 CFR 111.535(b).
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. Your response states a third-party consultant has been hired to perform a gap analysis of all your processes, including a process for tracking returns and documenting the disposal of the returned products. However, we are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you did not provide a copy of your written procedure for returned dietary supplements for review.
7. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for maintaining, cleaning, and sanitizing, as necessary, equipment, utensils, and any other contact surfaces that are used to manufacture, package, label, or hold components of dietary supplements for your BP NatRelief 11 and Edema NatRelief 6 products, as required by 21 CFR 111.25(c). Specifically, you did not provide any documentation to support your procedures for how you maintain, clean, and sanitize the utensils used in manufacturing processes.
We have reviewed your response, dated May 5, 2023. You state you will perform a gap assessment, and your processes for cleaning, and sanitizing of all equipment, utensils and any contact surfaces will be reviewed. You also stated a cleaning system will be put into place and SOPs defining the overall control of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of equipment, utensils and any other contact surfaces will be put into place as necessary. We are unable to evaluate your corrective action because you have not provided a written procedure for how you maintain, clean, and sanitize utensils and contact surfaces.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, even if your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 products were not unapproved new and misbranded drugs or adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the Act, these products would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements.
Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 products are misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] (section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act) because the serving size declared on the labels are incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 product labels “suggested use” and “recommendation” is declared as “1-2 capsules” but the serving size is listed as “1 Capsule.” The serving size should be declared as two (2) capsules.
2. Your Edema NatRelief 6 and BP NatRelief 11 products are misbranded within the meaning of 21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F) (section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act) in that the presentation of nutrition information on the labeling of the products is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9, and 21 CFR 101.4 For example:
The title, “Supplement Facts,” is not set at full width of the nutrition label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1). In addition, your Edema NatRelief 6 has the title “Supplement Facts” misspelled.
Your Edema NatRelief 6 does not have the dietary ingredients indented under the title “Proprietary Herbal Blend”, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. You did not follow your “Facility Sanitation” procedure in that your “Facility Cleaning Log” includes tasks such as “(b)(4),(b)(4)” and “(b)(4);” however, the “Facility Sanitation” procedure states tasks such as “(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4)” and “(b)(4).” Your firm’s written cleaning procedures must be consistent with your firm’s practices. You also must create and maintain cleaning monitoring records.
2. You must calibrate each instrument or control that you use in the manufacturing or testing of a component or dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.27(b), and you must make and keep documentation of the calibration each time the calibration is performed, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.35(b)(3).
3. The Latin binomial name for ginger is “Zingiber officinale”, not “Zingiber officinalis” in your Edema NatRelief 6 product’s label.
4. Regarding your BP NatRelief 11 product's other ingredients statement, there is no provision in the regulation to list ingredients that a product may contain. As such, ""May Contain"" is considered intervening material in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(e) in regards to this product's other ingredients list.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: 659194
Dear Jacqueline Baxas:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses https://www.plaquex.com/, https://biorica.biz/en/, https://www.facebook.com/www.biorica.biz/, and https://www.facebook.com/people/Plaquex/100063669775556/ in May 2023 and has determined that you take orders there for the product Plaquex® Oral Dietary Supplement. Your websites at https://www.plaquex.com/ and https://www.facebook.com/www.biorica.biz/ direct customers to your website https://biorica.biz/en/, to purchase your product Plaquex® Oral Dietary Supplement. Your website https://www.facebook.com/people/Plaquex/100063669775556/ directs customers to your website https://www.plaquex.com/, which then directs customers to your website https://biorica.biz/en/ to purchase your product.
The claims on your websites establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
On your website https://www.plaquex.com/:
“In 2006 Plaquex® Oral Gel Capsules were added to the treatment regimen. They improve blood lipids and liver and kidney function and thereby aid in the prevention of plaque deposits in between IV treatment sessions and after the infusion series is completed.”
On your website https://biorica.biz/en/:
“Plaquex Oral is indicated for lowering cholesterol levels, triglyceride levels and to improve liver function but also as a[n] additional treatment to Plaquex infusions to prevent re-formation of plaque in the blood vessels after removal. Plaquex Oral is also used in kidney disease as studies show that it increases creatinine and urea clearance in conjunction with Plaquex infusions. Studies in patients with Psoriasis and Neurodermitis show that skin manifestations recede faster and stay in remission longer than with placebo.”
On your Facebook social media website at https://www.facebook.com/people/Plaquex/100063669775556/:
On your Facebook home page: “A revived treatment to prevent heart attack, stroke, amputations and other nasty things like liver a [sic]”
In a July 31, 2017 post: “Can Plaquex® help prevent cancer?...Conclusion…In conclusion we can surmise that supplying phospholipids of the kind used in Plaquex® improves cell membrane function including the function of Sodium-potassium ATPase, and thus helps to maintain negative voltage in the cell preventing dedifferentiation of the cell into cancer cells. As the title says, this is only a thought experiment. Retrospective studies need to be done with patients doing Plaquex® therapy over a long period of time and comparing their rate of new cancers to the rate of a matched control group.”
In a July 29, 2017 post: “Can Plaquex® help prevent cancer?...When I linked the facts of these three independent information sources, the thought came to me, that Plaquex® – Phosphatidylcholine – may be able to prevent cancer.”
On your Facebook social media website at https://www.facebook.com/www.biorica.biz/:
In a August 19, 2016 post: “Stop buying lecithin and generic phosphatidylcholine products. Most will do more harm than good and actually increase plaque build-up in your arteries and cause fatty liver disease…You can help your body heal itself. Plaquex® Oral is a beautiful way to do just that…Imagine visiting your doctor one day as he smiles and says “Your cholesterol is back to normal!”…Plaquex® Oral can give you all this and more.”
Your Plaquex® Oral Dietary Supplement is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, it is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product Plaquex® Oral Dietary Supplement is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, Plaquex® Oral Dietary Supplement fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

Ref: CMS Case # 657518
Dear Mr. Moody:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 4041 S. River Rd., Saint George, Utah, from March 8, 2023 through March 15, 2023. Based on inspectional findings and review of the labels collected during the inspection, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
We received written correspondence from you dated March 30, 2023 to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to the applicable violation.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
During the inspection, our investigators found significant violations of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111), Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements. These violations cause the(b)(4), and(b)(4)sticks dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet cGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the cGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to, for each dietary supplement that you manufacture, establish product specifications for the strength and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, your finished product specification sheet for the(b)(4)dietary supplement finished product failed to include specifications for the strength and composition of each ingredient in the finished product.
Once you have established the required specifications, you must take specific actions to determine whether those specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75, and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
2. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the strength and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, your component specifications sheet you provided for the component(b)(4), an ingredient blend you use in the manufacture of(b)(4)sticks, did not include strength and composition specifications for the(b)(4)ingredients the product label lists as present in the blend.
Once you have established the required specifications, you must take specific actions to determine whether those specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75, and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We received your March 30, 2023, response, in which you said, “meetings have been conducted in researching HPLC [High Performance Liquid Chromatography] units” for use in testing, “current action is sending raw material samples to a third-party [l]aboratory . . . to obtain the information for purity and strength and to update specification sheets for each ingredient raw material,” and that you have added into your associated procedure “a clause where we will ask our vendor for a third-party testing COA [Certificate of Analysis]” for blended raw material ingredients (i.e.,(b)(4)). In your response, you did not provide evidence that the lacking component specifications have been established; thus, we are unable to assess the adequacy of your corrective action.
3. You failed to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient before using such component, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i). For example, your specification sheets you provided for the following components all list Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) testing as the method for verifying identity:(b)(4)and(b)(4)(used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)product) and(b)(4)(used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)product). However, during our inspection, you said your FTIR instrument has been broken since June 29, 2021 and you have not used it for identity testing since that time.
We received your March 30, 2023, response, in which you said your FTIR is still not functioning, you are sending raw material samples (including for the component(b)(4)) to a third-party laboratory for testing, and corrective actions will be completed within(b)(4)to(b)(4)to test all your existing ingredients. Although your response included a quotation from a third-party laboratory and you said you sent the component(b)(4)to the laboratory for testing, you did not include evidence that you have sent out samples to a third-party laboratory for testing, nor did you include any testing results. Therefore, we are unable to assess the adequacy of your corrective action.
4. You failed to confirm that the components you use meet the limits you have established on the types of contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). When relying on a COA from the supplier of the component that you receive, you failed to first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier’s COA through confirmation of the results of the supplier’s tests or examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(A). Specifically, during the inspection, you stated to our investigator that, to determine that the components you use meet the limits you have established on the types of contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, your firm relies on supplier COAs for raw materials, including dietary ingredients, because your firm does not conduct testing for limits on certain contaminants, such as heavy metals and pesticides for powdered components and microbial specifications for liquid components. However, you have not established the reliability of the supplier COAs. For example, you stated you have not confirmed the reliability of the COAs for(b)(4)and(b)(4)used in the(b)(4)Juice finished product, or of the COA for(b)(4)used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)finished product.
Additionally, you rely on supplier COAs that do not include test results for the contamination limits you have established, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(B). Specifically, the(b)(4)juice concentrate component specification includes limits for heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial content (including Salmonella and S. aureus); however, the COA for lot(b)(4)does not include test results for heavy metals, pesticides, Salmonella, or S. aureus. Likewise, the(b)(4)component specification includes limits for S. aureus; however, the COA for lot(b)(4)does not include test results for S. aureus. The(b)(4)concentrate and(b)(4)components were both used in the manufacture of(b)(4), lot(b)(4). Furthermore, the(b)(4)and(b)(4)component specifications include pesticide limits; however, the supplier COAs for lot(b)(4)of(b)(4)and for lot(b)(4)of(b)(4)do not include test results for pesticides. These components were used in the manufacture of(b)(4), lot(b)(4), and(b)(4), lot(b)(4), respectively.
We received your March 30, 2023, response. Your response stated you will be confirming the reliability of COAs using a third-party laboratory, but you did not include evidence of this being implemented. Therefore, we are unable to assess the adequacy of your corrective action.
5. Your quality control personnel failed to ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Specifically, the ingredients listed on the finished product labels of the dietary supplements you manufacture are inconsistent with the ingredients listed in the Master Manufacturing Records (MMRs) and batch production records (BPRs) for those finished products. For example, the(b)(4), batch record number(b)(4), lists(b)(4), and(b)(4)ingredients being added to the batch, but these ingredients are not declared on the finished product label.
In addition, the(b)(4), batch record number(b)(4), lists(b)(4)being added to the batch, but these ingredients are not listed on the finished product label.
6. Your MMRs for the(b)(4)Stick(b)(4), and(b)(4)USA finished dietary supplement products you manufacture failed to include all required information, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMRs fail to include the following information:
A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient [21 CFR 111.210(e)];
A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)];
Written instructions [21 CFR 111.210(h)], including the following:
o Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packed and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)].o Written procedure for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)].o Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)]. Such specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i)]; and For manual operations, such specific actions must include [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)]:A.(b)(4)weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A)]; andB.(b)(4)adding the component and another person verifying the addition [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B)].o Corrective action plans for use when specifications are not met. [21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)]
We received your March 30, 2023, response. Your response stated you will be revising your MMRs and you provided a checklist stating what you intend to include in your MMRs, but you did not include any revised MMRs for review. Therefore, we are unable to assess the adequacy of your corrective action.
7. You failed to establish BPRs that satisfy the requirements of 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 111.260. Specifically, the BPRs for(b)(4), lot number(b)(4)Sticks, lot number(b)(4), and(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), were missing the following:
The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)];
A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing [21 CFR 111.260(f)];
The actual results obtained during any monitoring operation [21 CFR 111.260(g)];
The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)];
Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with § 111.70(e) and (g) [21 CFR 111.260(i)];
Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including [21 CFR 111.260(j)]:
o The date on which each step of the MMR was performed [21 CFR 111.260(j)(1)];
Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations [21 CFR 111.260(k)], including:
o The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and, when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels [21 CFR 111.260(k)(1)];o The results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements (including repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements), or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results [21 CFR 111.260(k)(3)];
Documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel [21 CFR 111.260(l)]:
o Reviewed the batch production record [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)], including: Review of any monitoring operation required under subpart E of this part [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(i)]; and Review of the results of any tests and examinations, including tests and examinations conducted on components, in-process materials, finished batches of dietary supplements, and packaged and labeled dietary supplements [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(ii)]; ando Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch [21 CFR 111.260(l)(3)]; ando Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement, including any repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)(4)].
Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)].
We received your March 30, 2023, response. Your response stated you will be revising your BPRs and you provided a checklist stating what you intend to include in your BPRs, but you did not include a copy of any revised BPRs for review. Therefore, we are unable to assess the adequacy of your corrective action.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed your product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the(b)(4)Sticks, and(b)(4)products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the product label is false or misleading. Specifically, the product label states that the(b)(4)product contains “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4),” but the BPRs you provided to our investigator for(b)(4), lot number(b)(4)do not list any of these ingredients as being added to the product, demonstrating that these ingredients are not present in the(b)(4)product.
2. The(b)(4)Sitcks, and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that these product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
According to your BPRs for(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), provided to our investigator, the(b)(4)product is formulated with(b)(4). However, none of these ingredients are declared on the(b)(4)product’s label. In addition, according to your BPRs for(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), provided to our investigator, the(b)(4)product is formulated to contain(b)(4). However, none of these ingredients are declared on either products’ label.
The standardized common name (SCN) for “lychee” is “litchi” according to the reference Herbs of Commerce regarding the labeling on your(b)(4)Sticks product.
3. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the product label fails to include a serving size in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b). The term “serving” or “serving size” for a dietary supplement are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2, as the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion.
The serving size for the(b)(4)is 1 fluid one (fl oz) (30 milliliters [mL]) but recommended use on the product label states one to four fluid ounces(b)(4)daily
The serving size for(b)(4)is one (1) fl oz, but directions for use on the product label states(b)(4)fl oz one to(b)(4)times daily
4. The(b)(4)Sticks, and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9. For example:
Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in section 101.9(c), shall not be declared, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
The presentation of (b)(2)-dietary ingredients is not listed in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
A heavy bar is placed underneath the (b)(2)-ingredient “Calories”, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(5).
The type size of the (b)(2)-ingredient “Calories” in the(b)(4)product’s Supplement Facts label is not uniform with the other (b)(2)-ingredients, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e).
The(b)(4)product fails to declare the percentage DV for sodium in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C).
There is no provision in the regulation to provide a description of the(b)(4)within the ingredient list.
The(b)(4)product does not have a footnote linking the proprietary blend to the statement “Daily Value not established”, which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv).
There is no provision in the regulation for the(b)(4)product to bear the statement “The % Daily Value … general nutrition advice.” in the Supplement Facts label.
The Supplement Facts label on the(b)(4)product fails to express the Proprietary(b)(4)using metric measures in appropriate units (i.e., 1000 units must be declared in the next higher set of units, e.g., 1,100 mg must be expressed as 1.1 g) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).
5. The individual packet of(b)(4)Stick is misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 403(y)] because the packet label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761 of the Act) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We offer the following comments:
1. During the manufacture of your 100% juice product,(b)(4), the(b)(4)temperature recording charts and(b)(4)records showed that lots(b)(4), and(b)(4)deviated from your critical limits of fill temperature ≥(b)(4)°F and(b)(4)temperature of ≥(b)(4)°F for ≥(b)(4)at the(b)(4)critical control point, but no corrective actions were taken. As discussed during a Regulatory Meeting with your firm on November 14, 2018, it appears your firm uses a single thermal processing step sufficient to produce a shelf stable juice product, therefore your firm could be exempt from including control measures to produce a minimum 5-log reduction in their HACCP plan. Under 21 CFR 120.24(a)(2), a firm claiming such an exemption must include a copy of the thermal process in its written hazard analysis. You may work with a processing authority or otherwise maintain scientific and technical documents showing that the thermal process is sufficient to provide a shelf stable product.
2. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)product labels do not bear a symbol next to the structure/function claim linking the claim to the disclaimer, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(d). Furthermore, the disclaimer fails to be enclosed in a box on the(b)(4)product, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(d).
3. Regarding the ingredient list on the(b)(4)product label, FDA’s view is that “evaporated cane juice” is not the common or usual name for sugar or cane sugar. For additional information, see: https://www.fda.gov/media/97827/download
4. According to the COA for the stevia ingredient, this product appears to be an extract from the stevia leaf. Stevia must be listed in the Supplement Facts label as a botanical with a plant part designated if it is used as a dietary ingredient. If being used as a sweetener, only a GRAS ingredient may be added to a dietary supplement, such as a purified stevia extract (e.g., “rebaudioside A”).
5. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products’ information panels include nutrition, ingredient information, and manufacturer information intermingled with information that is considered intervening material. Examples of intervening material are “(b)(4)… analysis”, “Contains no added sugar …”, and “(b)(4)… antioxidants.” [21 CFR 101.2(e)].
6. Your use of “Best Used By” dates on the product labels should be supported by data that demonstrates the product’s shelf life.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your reply should be addressed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Attn: Kathy Tormey, Compliance Officer; 6th Ave and Kipling St, DFC Bldg. 20, PO Box 25087, Denver, Colorado, 80225-0087. You may reach Ms. Tormey at Kathleen.tormey@fda.hhs.gov or (303) 236-3137 if you have any questions about this matter.

WARNING LETTER
Date: October 24, 2023
Warning Letter #669353
Dear Mr. Ford:
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your company’s websites at www.abbottnutrition.com, www.abbott.com, and www.pediatricproconnect.com in October 2023 and your company’s marketing materials for Similac® Probiotic Tri-Blend (hereinafter Similac Probiotic Supplement or your product), which contains instructions on where to buy your product. The marketing materials FDA reviewed include one handout that bears the heading “Probiotics and Preterm Infants: Clinical Evidence” and another that bears the heading “The Promise of Similac Another Innovation Only From Similac,” which your sales representatives provided together to hospital staff. You refer to your product as a probiotic and offer it for sale to health care professionals in the United States. Your product is labeled as containing, among other ingredients,Bifidobacterium infantis(Bb-02) andStreptococcus thermophilus(TH-4®), otherwise known asB. infantis(Bb-02) andS. thermophilus(TH-4®), and you sell it for use in preterm infants.
Based on the statements on your website and your marketing materials, your product is an unapproved new drug and unlicensed biological product that you introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)] and the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) [42 U.S.C. § 262(a)(1)]. Your Similac Probiotic Supplement is also adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) and (f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i) and (f)(1)(B)] because it containsB. infantis(Bb-02), an unsafe food additive within the meaning of sections 201(s) and 409(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§321(s) and 348]; andS. thermophilus(TH-4®), a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, when used in preterm infants. These violations are described in more detail below.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering your product for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act and the PHS Act. You can find the FD&C Act, PHS Act, and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drug and Unlicensed Biological Product
Your “Probiotics and Preterm Infants: Clinical Evidence” handout provided by your sales representative to hospital staff has a section with the heading “Probiotics in the NICU: Clinical Evidence” that states, “Probiotics have shown to significantly improve outcomes” for “All-cause mortality,” “Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),” “Late-onset sepsis,” and “Feeding tolerance,” and that represents “Benefits of probiotics on NEC,” as “significantly reduc[ing] incidence of NEC in clinical studies.” The other marketing handout with the heading “The Promise of Similac Another Innovation Only From Similac” states that Similac® Probiotic Supplement undergoes safety testing to “ensure the probiotic is ready for hospital use,” (emphasis omitted).
Your website at www.pediatricproconnect.com (last visited in October 2023), includes a link to an Abbott infographic entitled “The Microbiome & The Preterm Infant: Gut Immaturity & Dysbiosis,” which states, “Importantly, giving probiotics to preterm infants can reduce the incidence of NEC.” As noted above, your www.abbottnutrition.com website and documents accessed from it further state that your product is available for “Hospitals and institutions,” and your Pediatric Product Nutrition Guide categorizes the product as for “Premature/ Low-Birth-Weight Infants.”
Because these statements indicate that your product is intended for use in the mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, your product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)]. Additionally, your product is a biological product as defined in section 351(i) of the PHS Act [42 U.S.C. § 262(i)], because it is applicable to the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of human beings.
Please be advised that to lawfully market a drug that is also a biological product, a valid biologics license application (BLA) must be in effect [42 U.S.C. § 262(a)]. Such licenses are issued only after a demonstration that the product is safe, pure, and potent. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug application (IND) in effect as specified by FDA regulations (21 U.S.C. § 355(i); 42 U.S.C. § 262(a)(3); 21 CFR Part 312). Your product is not the subject of an approved BLA nor is there an IND in effect for its use. Based on this information, your actions have violated the FD&C Act and the PHS Act.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement
In addition to your Similac Probiotic Supplement being an unapproved new drug and unlicensed biological product, your product is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) and (f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i) and (f)(1)(B)].
Unsafe Food Additive: Bifidobacterium infantis (Bb-02)
Your Similac Probiotic Supplement is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because, when used in food for preterm infants,B. infantis(BB-02) is an unsafe food additive within the meaning of sections 201(s) and 409(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§321(s) and 348(a)].
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any substance added or intended for addition to food must have premarket approval by FDA as a food additive for that use unless the use is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts or meets one of the listed exceptions at section 201(s)(1)-(6) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)(1)-(6)]. Otherwise, the substance is deemed an unsafe food additive, and food that is or contains an unsafe food additive is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use ofB. infantis(Bb-02). In addition, as discussed below, we are not aware of an applicable exception under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] for the use ofB. infantis(Bb-02) in dietary supplements or in conventional foods, nor are we aware of a basis to conclude that any use ofB. infantis(Bb-02) in dietary supplements or otherwise in food for preterm infants is generally recognized as safe (GRAS).
We are not aware of an applicable exception under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] for the use ofB. infantis(BB-02) in dietary supplements or in conventional foods. Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. The label of your Similac Probiotic Supplement declaresB. infantis(Bb-02) as a dietary ingredient. However, the ingredientB. infantis(Bb-02) does not meet the definition of a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.B. infantis(Bb-02) does not fall within any of these categories. Therefore, the ingredientB. infantis(Bb-02) used in your product is a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement and must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
We are not aware of a basis to conclude that any use ofB. infantis(Bb-02) in dietary supplements or food for preterm infants is GRAS. GRAS status requires publicly available evidence that the intended use is safe and a consensus among qualified experts that the intended use is safe (21 CFR 170.30). The information on the use of living microorganisms (also referred to as “probiotics”), such asB. infantis(Bb-02), by preterm infants in the scientific literature raises serious safety concerns. Preterm infants are a highly susceptible, heterogenous subpopulation of varying ages (<37 weeks of gestation) and weight, who are physiologically, developmentally, and metabolically immature compared to healthy term infants, resulting in their having a high risk for morbidity and mortality and requiring specialized care; thus, we have greater safety concerns for this population than we have for a healthy term infant population. Because their gastrointestinal system is not fully matured, preterm infants have more permeable intestinal linings, often referred to as “leaky guts,” and motility problems, which can lead to opportunistic infections and sepsis when ingesting living microorganisms. The current published literature does not show consensus among qualified experts that the use of living microorganisms in preterm infants is safe. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not endorse the routine use of living microorganisms in preterm infants, finding conflicting data on its safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population, particularly those with birth weight <1000 grams.”
Although your Similac Probiotic Supplement label states that the product is “not intended for infants with compromised intestinal permeability,” and your Pediatric Product Nutrition Guide states that your product is “not intended for infants with intestinal permeability,” other marketing materials of yours directly contradict these statements. For example, your infographic titled, “How Probiotics Can Help My Preterm Infant, Infancy is an Important Time in Developing a Healthy Gut Microbiome,” acknowledges that the “[g]ut is not fully developed” in many preterm infants and nonetheless recommends your product be administered to this population because probiotics “increase the number of good bacteria in the gut, promoting a healthy microbiome.” Moreover, you categorize your product as a dietary supplement for premature/low-birth-weight infants in your Pediatric Product Nutrition Guide, and in your “Probiotics and Preterm Infants: Clinical Evidence” marketing handout that your sales representatives distribute to NICU dieticians, you have indicated that this product is designed specifically for preterm infants. Furthermore, statements on the product page of your website indicate your product is available for “Hospitals and institutions” and your “The Promise of Similac: Another Innovation Only From Similac” information sheet describes product testing to ensure it is “ready for hospital use.” The care of infants in a healthcare setting includes care of preterm infants; therefore, this use is further evidence of the intended use of this product for consumption by preterm infants.
B. infantis(Bb-02) is not GRAS for use in food for preterm infants. BecauseB. infantis(Bb-02) is not a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, and because your Similac Probiotic Supplement is intended to be added to food for preterm infants, your Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act becauseB. infantis(Bb-02) is an unsafe food additive for use by premature infants within the meaning of sections 201(s) and 409 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(s) and 348]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Section 402(f)(1)(B) Adulteration: Streptococcus thermophilus(TH-4®)
The label of your Similac Probiotic Supplement declaresS. thermophilus(TH-4®) as a dietary ingredient.S. thermophilus(TH-4®) is a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)].S. thermophilus(TH-4®) is also a new dietary ingredient under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)], in that it is a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994.
A dietary supplement is adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act if it contains a new dietary ingredient for which there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. The available scientific information regarding the safety of S. thermophilus (TH-4®), when intended for consumption by preterm infants, indicates that there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance thatS. thermophilus(TH-4®) does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. In fact, as noted above, available information on the use of microorganisms in products intended for preterm infants raises serious safety concerns. Therefore, your Similac Probiotic Supplement is an adulterated dietary supplement under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)] because it contains a new dietary ingredient,S. thermophilus(TH-4®), for which there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury when used in preterm infants. Introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)]. The violations cited in this letter are not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for promptly investigating and determining the causes of any violations, correcting them, and preventing their recurrence, and ensuring full compliance with the law.
We advise you to comprehensively review your website, product labels, and other labeling and marketing materials to ensure that you are lawfully marketing your product in full compliance with the FD&C Act, the PHS Act, and their implementing regulations. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in enforcement action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. If you believe that your product is not in violation of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration in your response to this letter.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify FDA in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct any violations. Your response should include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as related documentation. If you cannot complete all corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will complete the correction.
Your written response should be sent to the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Document Control Center, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue, WO71-G112, Silver Spring, MD 20993-0002.

WARNING LETTERCMS Case #655674
August 1, 2023Dear Isaiah Orton-Bey and Maria LeMay-Bey:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility at 16136 W. 7 Mile Road, Livonia, MI 48235-2903 from February 13, 2023 to March 16, 2023. Additionally, FDA reviewed your website at https://moorherbs.com in May 2023. The inspection and our review of your website revealed serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
At the close of the inspection, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). We received your response to the FDA 483 on April 3, 2023. We address your response below.

Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)].
With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Anti-Viral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”), “Brain Tune-Up,” “Healthy Mommy Healthy Baby,” “HyperThyroidism” (also referred to as “HyperThyroid Support”), “HypoThroidism” (also referred to as “HypoThyroid Support”), “ResErection Extra Strength w/Yohimbe Bark,” “Tumor Release” (also referred to as “Tumor & Cyst Support”), “Venereal Defense,” and “Womb Care Cramp Relief & Fibroid Release” (also referred to as “Womb Care: Fibroid and Tumor Release”) products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Anti-Viral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”), “Brain Tune-Up,” “Healthy Mommy Healthy Baby,” “HyperThyroidism” (also referred to as “HyperThyroid Support”), “HypoThroidism” (also referred to as “HypoThyroid Support”), “ResErection Extra Strength w/Yohimbe Bark,” “Tumor Release” (also referred to as “Tumor & Cyst Support”), “Venereal Defense,” and “Womb Care Cramp Relief & Fibroid Release” (also referred to as “Womb Care: Fibroid and Tumor Release”) products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The dietary supplements manufactured at your facility are adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulation for dietary supplements (21 CFR Part 111). During the inspection of your facility, FDA investigators observed the following significant violations of the CGMP regulation for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to establish the specifications required under 21 CFR 111.70. Specifically:
a. You failed to establish the following required component specifications under 21 CFR 111.70(b) for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement: (1) identity specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1); and (2) component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, when our investigators requested such component specifications for the Coltsfoot, Wild Cherry Bark, and Boneset Herb ingredients used in the manufacturing of your “Lungs & Respiratory” finished dietary supplement product, you were unable to provide such component specifications. We have reviewed your written response on April 3, 2023, in which you state that you “are in the process of establishing component specifications for identity, purity, strength and composition of the finished dietary supplement.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
b. You failed to establish specifications for dietary supplement labels (labeling specifications), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). Specifically, you were unable to provide labeling specifications for your “Anti-Viral,” “Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), and “Lungs & Respiratory” finished dietary supplement products when requested by our investigators. We have reviewed your written response on April 3, 2023, in which you state that you are in the process of establishing written labeling specifications. We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
c. You failed to establish specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you were unable to provide finished product specifications for your “Anti-Viral,” “Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), and “Lungs & Respiratory” finished dietary supplement products when requested by our investigators. We have reviewed your written response on April 3, 2023, in which you state that you “are in the process of establishing product specifications for identity, purity, strength and composition of the finished dietary supplement.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
We note that once you have established these specifications, you must determine whether the specifications that you establish under 21 CFR 111.70 are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, once you have established component specifications and before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Further, you must verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c).
You must also make and keep records, including records for the specifications you establish, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103, and make and keep records of such procedures, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b)(1). Specifically, you told our investigators that you have no written procedures for quality control operations and that you do not have a quality control program in place.
We have reviewed your written response received on April 3, 2023, in which you state that you “are in the process of implementing quality control operations to ensure the quality of dietary supplements” and “are also in the process of establishing written procedures and training quality control personnel to ensure all is produced safely, accurately, and according to the standards we have, and are putting, in place.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
3. You did not prepare and follow a master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Upon request, you could not provide written MMRs for your “Anti-Viral,” “Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), and “Lungs & Respiratory” finished dietary supplement products to our investigators. You stated that you did not have these records, and none were provided.
We have reviewed your written response received on April 3, 2023, in which you state that you “are in the process of establishing Master Manufacturing Records for each dietary supplement and size.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
4. Your batch production record did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required under 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260.

5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the requirements to review and investigate a product complaint, as required under 21 CFR 111.553. Specifically, our investigators requested your written procedures to review and investigate a product complaint. You stated that you did not have this procedure, and you did not provide it.
We have reviewed your April 3, 2023, written response, in which you state, “We’ve been operating since March of 2015 and have never received a complaint. However, we are in the process of establishing written procedures for reviewing and investigating product/customer complaints.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
6. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for when a returned dietary supplement is received, as required under 21 CFR 111.503. Specifically, our investigators requested your written procedures for when a returned dietary supplement is received. You stated that you did not have these written procedures, and none were provided.
We have reviewed your April 3, 2023, written response, in which you state that you “are in the process of establishing written procedures for when a returned dietary supplement is received.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
7. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, during the inspection, you said you had not established written procedures for holding and distributing operations.

8. You did not maintain and clean equipment, utensils, and contact surfaces used to manufacture, package, label, or hold components or dietary supplements, as required under 21 CFR 111.27(d). P
Specifically, on(b)(4), during the manufacturing of your “Lungs & Respiratory” finished dietary supplement product, your multi-functional grinder was observed with a light green and brown residue inside the bowl and the(b)(4)plastic capsule filling equipment was observed with a light brown powder and brown staining. Furthermore, the method you used for cleaning and sanitizing your utensils and equipment does not align with, and directly contradicts, the manufacturer’s written instructions on the cleaning and sanitizing products. Additionally, you do not have any written procedures for cleaning or sanitizing your utensils and equipment, as required under 21 CFR 111.25(c).
We have reviewed your April 3, 2023, written response, in which you state that you “have since corrected the way we wash and sanitize our utensils and equipment, according to the instructions indicated on the cleaning agents we use, combined with regulations outlined under Michigan Food Law.” These corrections will be evaluated during the next FDA inspection of your firm. You also stated in your response that you “are in the process of establishing written procedures for cleaning and sanitizing utensils and equipment.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide any additional evidence or supporting documentation for review.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your “Lungs and Respiratory,”“Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Antiviral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”),, “Headache & Pain Relief,” and “Bright Eyes” products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your “Lungs and Respiratory,”“Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Antiviral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”), “Headache & Pain Relief,” and “Bright Eyes” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labels is are incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Your Lungs and Respiratory, Full Body Antibiotic, Antiviral, Blood Pressure Normalizer, Headache & Pain Relief, and Bright Eyes product labels’ serving sizes is declared as “3 Capsules or 3 Scoops” and are not specific to each product.
2. Your “Lungs and Respiratory,”“Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Antiviral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”), “Headache & Pain Relief,” and “Bright Eyes” products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. Specifically,• The title “Supplement Facts” is not set at full width of the nutrition label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).• The dietary ingredients are not indented under the title “Proprietary Herbal Blend”, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).• The quantitative amount by weight per serving of proprietary blend does not use metric measures in appropriate units (i.e., 1000 units must be declared in the next higher set of units, e.g., 10000 mg must be expressed as 10 g), in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).
3. Your Lungs and Respiratory,”“Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”),, “Headache & Pain Relief,"" and “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”) products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] in that the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1) and 101.36(d)(1). If the whole or entire part is used, this must be declared.
4. Your “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”) and “Headache & Pain Relief” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4(h). For example:• The Blood Pressure Normalizer product label lists “manjishtha”, but this is not the standardized common name of the dietary ingredient. The label must list the standardized common name (SCN) given in the reference Herbs of Commerce, “Indian madder”. The Ayurvedic name for Indian madder (manjishtha) may follow the SCN in parentheses.• The SCN for the term “Chaksu” must be declared; in the absence of a SCN, the Latin binomial name must be declared.• The Headache & Pain Relief product declares “dashmoola”. The dietary ingredient(s) that make up the “dashmoola” must be declared by the SCN; in the absence of a SCN, the Latin binomial name for the dietary ingredient must be declared.
5. Your “Lungs and Respiratory,”“Full Body Antibiotic” (also referred to as “Antibiotic, Full Body”), “Antiviral,” “Blood Pressure” (also referred to as “Blood Pressure Normalizer”), “Headache & Pain Relief,” and “Bright Eyes” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] of the Act because the labels fail to declare all ingredients, as required by 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, the products fail to declare the ingredients of the capsule material.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: CMS Case #652059
Dear Dr. Benjamin T. Johnson:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility located at 30746 Bryant Dr, Unit 410, Evergreen, CO from January 5, 2023, through January 13, 2023. Following the inspection, we reviewed your product labels for your Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir, Sugar Detox Elixir, and Elevate products, and your website at the Internet address http://osmosisbeauty.com, from which website you take orders for your Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir, Sugar Detox Elixir, and Elevate products. The inspection and our review of your product labels and website revealed serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We received your email response, dated January 31, 2023, which was written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your product labels and website in June 2023 and has determined that your Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir, Sugar Detox Elixir, and Elevate products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Product: Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir
On your product label:• “Renowned for its ability to . . . reduce inflammation…”• “…detoxifies eczema, psoriasis, and inflamed skin”• “Balances digestive causes of rosacea and neutralizes skin toxins”
On your website, http://osmosisbeauty.com:• “Skin Perfection contains edible 24-karat gold, and our exclusive, clinically proven technology that targets the source of redness, inflammation, and blemishes.”• “TOP BENEFITS: Balances digestive causes of Rosacea, Eczema, and Psoriasis, Neutralizes skin toxins”• “RECOMMENDED FOR: … Eczema/Psoriasis, Rosacea, Other Candida related skin conditions”
Product: Osmosis Sugar Detox Elixir
On your product label:• “Renowned for its ability to … reduce inflammation…”• “Harmonizes the pancreas and sugar regulation”
On your website, http://osmosisbeauty.com:• “Improve sugar regulation, detox sweeteners, and harmonize your pancreas with our Sugar Detox Elixir. This supplement is especially vital for those who have diabetes…”• “TOP BENEFITS: Harmonizes the pancreas and sugar regulation”• “RECOMMENDED FOR: Diabetes and related neuropathy, Sugar cravings”
Product: Osmosis Elevate
On your website, http://osmosisbeauty.com:• “This new and improved version of Elevate … continues to offer clinically proven benefits in reducing cholesterol and triglycerides…”• “RECOMMENDED FOR: … High blood pressure/cholesterol”
Your above products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir, Sugar Detox Elixir, and Elevate products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Osmosis Skin Perfection Elixir, Sugar Detox Elixir, and Elevate fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
During the inspection, our investigator found significant violations of FDA’s regulation for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the inspection, we determined that these violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection, you informed our investigator that you did not have any written procedures for quality control operations.
We received your January 31, 2023, response which states, “[W]e will develop written QC procedures for all areas of the department and formalize them as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Estimated timeline(b)(4).” Your response did not include any written quality control procedures or other evidence that you have implemented corrective actions. Further, you did not indicate whether you will continue production of dietary supplements while you are developing your quality control SOPs.
2. You firm failed to establish and follow written procedures for maintaining, cleaning, and sanitizing, as necessary, all equipment, utensils, and any other contact surfaces that are used to package, label, or hold your dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.25(c). For example, you use(b)(4)to remove dust before filling the bottle with product; however, during the inspection, you were unable to provide documentation on the specifications and maintenance of the(b)(4).
We also note that you must implement the required sanitizing procedure by maintaining, cleaning, and sanitizing, as necessary, all equipment, utensils, and contact surfaces used to manufacture, package, label, or hold components or dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.27(d), and you must make and keep cleaning and sanitization records as required by 21 CFR 111.35(a).
3. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements related to product complaints, as required by 21 CFR 111.553. Specifically, you do not have written procedures for reviewing and investigating product complaints. Once you establish written procedures for the requirements of product complaints, you must include all the requirements in accordance 21 CFR 111.560.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned dietary supplements, including the procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.503. Specifically, during the inspection you confirmed that you have no written procedures for handling returned products.
We received your January 31, 2023, response which states, “We will develop an SOP to outline complete information relating to all product returns and restocking of inventory. Estimated timeline(b)(4).” Your response did not include any evidence that you have implemented corrective actions. Further, you did not indicate whether you will continue production of dietary supplements while you are developing your written SOP.
We also note that you must make and keep records of your compliance with such requirements for returned dietary supplements, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.535(b).
5. Your firm failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, during the inspection you confirmed that have no written procedures for the holding and distribution of your dietary supplement products.
We received your January 31, 2023, response which states, “We will develop an SOP for holding and distributing operations of all dietary supplements. Estimated timeline =(b)(4).” Your response did not include any evidence that you have implemented corrective actions. Further, you did not indicate whether you will continue production of dietary supplements while you are developing your written SOP.
We also note that you must make and keep records of such written procedures, as required by 21 CFR 111.475(b)(1).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your Skin Clarifier, Recovery, Regenerate, Immune Defense Elixir, and Elevate products are misbranded dietary supplement within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
a) Your Osmosis Elevate, Skin Clarifier, Recovery, and Regenerate products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the labels fail to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person may receive a report of a serious adverse event.
b) Your Osmosis Immune Defense Elixir product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 343(q)(1)(A)], because the serving sizes declared on the label is incorrect and/or incomplete. Serving Size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example, your product label only lists the serving size for one of the intended consumer groups listed in the “Suggested Use” panel. As your product is intended for varying weight groups, you must list the serving size for each group in your Supplement Facts label.
c) Your Osmosis Recovery, Elevate, Skin Clarifier, and Immune Defense Elixir products are misbranded with the meaning of 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
• Your Osmosis Recovery product,- declares Calories from Fat; however, there is no provision for this declaration in the Supplement Facts label. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)]- fails to correctly place Calories, a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient along with any other (b)(2)-dietary ingredient below the headings “Amount Per Serving” and % Daily Value. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B)]- declares an incorrect Total Fat % Daily Value based upon the quantitative amount of 15 grams per serving [21 CFR 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B)].- declares “unsaturated fat” in the Supplement Facts label.; there is no provision for this in the regulation. However, there is a provision for the voluntary declaration of monounsaturated or polyunsaturated fat. [21 CFR 101.9(c)(2) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)]- fails to indent the list of ingredients of the proprietary blend below the name “Proprietary Blend”. Likewise, the listed fatty acid constituents must be indented below the list of proprietary blend ingredients [21 CFR101.36(c)(2))
• Your Osmosis Elevate product incorrectly lists potassium, a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient in the Supplement Facts label. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient that is not present, or that is present in an amount that can be declared as zero in section 21 CFR 101.9(c), must not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals). The source of the ingredient, i.e., potassium citrate must be listed in the Other Ingredients list. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)]• Your Osmosis Immune Defense Elixir fails to provide the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each intended group in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).• Your Osmosis Recovery, Regenerate, Skin Clarifier and Immune Defense Elixir products fail to set the “Supplement Facts” full width of the nutrition label. [21 CFR 101.36(e)(1)]• Your Osmosis Regenerate and Skin Clarifier products fail to declare the quantitative amount by weight of each dietary ingredient per serving using metric measures in appropriate units (i.e., 1000 units must be declared in the next higher set of units, e.g., 1,100mg must be expressed as 1.1 g) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A). Likewise, milligram or milliliter declarations should be rounded to the nearest unit.• Your Osmosis Skin Clarifier declares enzyme assay units in the Supplement Facts label, however, there is no provision in the regulation for this declaration.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:• The statement of identity “dietary supplement” on your Osmosis Skin Clarifier, Elevate, Recovery, Regenerate and Immune Defense Elixir products must be presented in bold type on the principal display panel, in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the panel in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3(d).• Your Osmosis Elevate, Skin Clarifier, Recovery, Regenerate, Immune Defense Elixir product labels each fail to bear a symbol next to all structure/function claims linking the claim to the disclaimer, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93 and (d). For example, we note use of the term “wellness” is a structure function claim.• Your Osmosis Skin Clarifier product declares “herb” which is not a plant part. If the entire or whole plant is used, then that information must be declared.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Dear Suk H. Cho:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 3350 Marquis Dr., Garland, TX from April 6, 2021, through May 4, 2021. Based on the inspectional findings and review of your product labels we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We received your written response letters dated May 25, 2021, August 23, 2021, November 22, 2021, February 18, 2022, and July 28, 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We have reviewed those responses and our comments are listed following each of the significant violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements.
1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminants that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have no product specifications for the(b)(4)Multimineral product that you manufacture.
We have reviewed your written responses.
Your July 28, 2022 response states that Cosmax has completed the full review and updates to finished product specifications and has corrected all finished product specifications for products being manufactured and distributed to customers. Your response includes revised finished product specifications for your products, including:(b)(4)Multimineral.
Based on our review of the revised finished product specifications, your response is inadequate because the finished product specifications do not meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically,
For the(b)(4)Multimineral, the specification for Taste/Aroma states “Meets Reference.” “Meets Reference” does not provide a description of the taste or smell that is characteristic of the products.
2. You failed to establish component specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b), for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. Specifically, you did not establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, you have not established component specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of your(b)(4). We also note that you must establish an identity specification for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). The identification specification for each ingredient states “Validated Ref STD.” The specification is not appropriate because it does not state the specific acceptance criteria for comparison that will be used to confirm the identity of the ingredient for the test performed.
Before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). You must also ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
We have reviewed your responses, and we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. The documents that you purport to be component specifications in your May 25, 2021 and November 22, 2021 responses do not demonstrate that you have established specifications for purity, strength, and composition of the components that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met.
3. You failed to verify that your finished batch of(b)(4)Lot(b)(4)meets products specifications for limits for those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of dietary supplement specifically, pesticides as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, the pesticide testing report dated 06/09/2020 for the finished product(b)(4)from your third-party party lab, had the product lot #(b)(4)crossed out and changed to lot #(b)(4)(the hand-written change was initialed and dated as “AS 06/09/2020” only on page 1 of 5 of the pesticide test record). Upon review of the Batch Manufacturing Records for(b)(4)Lot #(b)(4), it was observed that this product lot was manufactured on 09/22/2020, 3 months after the pesticide results were generated from the third-party lab.
We have reviewed your responses in which you state the observation resulted from a failure to comply with the firm’s Good Documentation Practices procedure SOP AGP-017 “Good Documentation Practices”; for which you re-trained your employees on SOP AGP-017. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because that you did not provide documentation to support that you have verified that(b)(4)Lot #(b)(4)meets product specifications for pesticides.
4. Before using a component, you failed to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i). Specifically, your firm received the dietary ingredient(b)(4), lot #(b)(4), on June 5, 2019. This was used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement(b)(4)(lot #(b)(4)), which was distributed to your customer on March 11 and 30, 2021. The raw material was not tested for identity until April 5, 2021.
Your firm’s May 25, 2021 response indicated that raw materials received prior to June 2020 could be approved in your system without identification testing being performed. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation to support that you have conducted identity testing for those dietary ingredients received prior to 2020 that remain in your inventory.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, the products,(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are misbranded dietary supplements within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. The(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
The(b)(4)product Supplement Facts label fails to declare the nutrition information for which the product is intended. The percent of Daily Value shall be based on RDI or DRV values for adults and children 4 or more years of age, unless the product is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section.
The(b)(4)product label declares dietary ingredients with amounts of 0 or percent Daily Values of 0 or <2%. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
The(b)(4)product label fails to declare milligrams as the unit of measure for copper. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(i) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv)]
The Quinol Turmeric product bears the following statement: “Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
The(b)(4)product declares “Vitamin D3” in the Supplement Facts label which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B) and 101.9(c)(8)(iv).
The(b)(4)nutrition information declares 10 calories per serving; however, the amount does not appear to correlate with the macronutrient that is listed. Likewise, the(b)(4)nutrition information declares 5 calories per serving and there are no macronutrients listed to correlate with the amount.
2. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example,
The(b)(4)and product labels list the ingredient stevia extract (leaves) but do not specify the steviol glycoside. We note your MMR for each product indicates the ingredient is Stevia leaf 97% (Rebaudioside A 97%). The common or usual name for highly purified steviol glycosides depends on the ingredient composition. If the sweetener is purified to contain 95 percent or more of a single steviol glycoside, the specific name of that single steviol glycoside is the common or usual name. For example, the name “rebaudioside A” should be used for ingredients with 95% or more rebaudioside A; the name “stevioside” should be used for ingredients with 95% or more stevioside. If the sweetener is purified to contain 95 percent or more of a mixture of two or more steviol glycosides, the name “steviol glycosides” would be the common or usual name.
The(b)(4)product lists the ingredients “(b)(4)”, each of which is not the common or usual name of the ingredient.
We also offer the following comments:
1. During the inspection, your firm’s product “(b)(4)32 fl oz.” was documented as an acidified food. FDA acknowledges your firm’s response which indicates that you had submitted the Food Canning Establishment registration, which has been verified, and are working with a process authority to evaluate and define a scheduled process. Failure to implement proper acidified food quality control procedures could result in finish foods that present a health hazard. Your firm’s compliance with acidified food regulations will be assessed during the next inspection.
2. For the(b)(4)product, the current regulation pertaining to nutrition information allows the voluntary listing of Calories from Saturated Fat, and not Calories from Total Fat. [21 CF 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(i)(ii)].
3. The(b)(4)product declares the statement of identity “dietary supplement.” However, we note the label also declares “(b)(4)”. Per Section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)], the term “dietary supplement” means a product that is not represented for use as a conventional food or as a sole item of a meal or the diet. As such, your product cannot be labeled as a dietary supplement, and simultaneously represented for use as a conventional food.
4. The(b)(4)product declares the statement “Manufactured in a facility that processes egg, wheat, milk, soy, tree nuts, peanut, fish & shellfish products.” The use of an advisory label such as this is not an acceptable substitute for food allergen control procedures to prevent cross contact. The firm should make every effort to assure that they and their suppliers have adequate GMP's in place to prevent the un-intentional inclusion of allergens in their products and ingredients.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to Chad J. Whitwell, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 1201 Main St, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202. If you have questions regarding any issues in this letter, please contact Mr. Whitwell at 214-253-5328.

With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Lymf (Galium aparine), Natural Supplements for Cardiomyopathy, Magic1 (Moringa oleifera), Natural Supplements for Diabetes Mellitus, Cinna (Cinnamomum Zeylanicum), Natural Supplements for High Blood Pressure – Hypertension, kraph (Apium graveolens), Natural Supplements for Stroke – CVA, Cam1 (Silybum marianum), Danshen (Red sage), Multiple Sclerosis Package, and Smile Package are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Lymf (Galium aparine), Natural Supplements for Cardiomyopathy, Magic1 (Moringa oleifera), Natural Supplements for Diabetes Mellitus, Cinna (Cinnamomum Zeylanicum), Natural Supplements for High Blood Pressure – Hypertension, kraph (Apium graveolens), Natural Supplements for Stroke – CVA, Cam1 (Silybum marianum), Danshen (Red sage), Multiple Sclerosis Package, and Smile Package fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

WARNING LETTER
CMS # 645336Dear Mr. Tsai:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, located at 9250 Jeronimo Rd., Irvine, CA 92618, on September 19-21, 29 and October 5, 2022. In February 2023, we also reviewed your website at the Internet address https://sunten.com/. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your website, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address https://sunten.com/ in February 2023, and has determined that you take orders there for the products Yi Min, Jian Shen, Yu Zhi, Xiao Yan, Qu Yu, Yi Jun, Platcladus Leaves Ce Bai Ye, and Shu Jin 2. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Yi Min
“Relief of allergy related symptoms”
Jian Shen
“Improve… low blood sugars”
Yu Zhi
“Relief of hemorrhoids conditions and constipation”
Xiao Yan
“Reduce urinary tract infections symptoms”
Qu Yu
“Support trauma injury relief”
Yi Jun
“Relief of inflammation and fungal infection”
Platcladus Leaves Ce Bai Ye
“Aids in stopping bleeding”
Shu Jin 2
“Relief of pain and stiffness in the lower body”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Jian Shen, Xiao Yan, and Platcladus Leaves Ce Bai Ye are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Jian Shen, Xiao Yan, and Platcladus Leaves Ce Bai Ye fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The facility inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on these violations, your Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan,(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. Your firm failed to establish a specification for every point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically:
a. You failed to establish an identity specification for each component you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). For example, the identification specification for the Lycium Formula (Huan Shao Dan) dietary ingredient for your Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan finished product lists a specification as “Positive” and a testing result of “Confirm.” The Material Test Report related to this dietary ingredient has a differing specification of “Positive (Match with(b)(4)Standard)” and a result stated as “conforms” for Lycium Formula (Huan Shao Dan), lot number(b)(4). “Positive” and “Positive (Match with(b)(4)Standard)” do not provide specific ranges or parameters regarding the testing method used to determine if a dietary ingredient has been appropriately identified. In addition, a testing report should show various bands relating to the components of the blend or the dominant constituents of each ingredient for this type of multi-ingredient product;
b. You failed to establish specifications that are necessary to ensure that the specifications for purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, you did not have specifications for the ingredients Fructus Foeniculi and Radix Rehmanniae praeparata to ensure the purity, strength, and composition specifications will be met for the Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan finished product; and
c. You failed to establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). For example, you did not establish specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition for your Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan finished product.
Once you have established specifications, you must determine whether the specifications that you establish under 21 CFR 111.70 are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Further, you must verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). You must also make and keep records, including records for the specifications you establish, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
In addition, under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2), you must either conduct appropriate tests or examinations or rely on a certificate of analysis (COA) from the supplier of the component that you receive, provided that the COA meets specific requirements. To the extent you receive dietary ingredients from suppliers from which you receive a COA, you may only rely on a COA if the following conditions are met: (A) you first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier's COA through confirmation of the results of the supplier's tests or examinations; (B) the COA includes a description of the test or examination method(s) used, limits of the test or examinations, and actual results of the tests or examinations; (C) you maintain documentation of how you qualified the supplier; (D) you periodically reconfirm the supplier's COA; and (E) your quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and re‐qualification) of any supplier.
We have reviewed your responses, dated October 20, 2022, and November 7, 2022. Your October 2022 response included a revised identification specification for the Lycium Formula (Huan Shao Dan) dietary ingredient. This revised specification continues to have “Confirm” as the testing result and does not provide any quantitative data to determine the ingredient’s identity has been confirmed.
The component specification sheets provided in your October 2022 response include an identity specification for(b)(4), and(b)(4)(components of your(b)(4)product) listing a retention value (Rf value) via(b)(4)analysis for each dietary ingredient. The Rf values identified in your Raw Material Specification sheets differ from the Rf values identified in the ingredient supplier’s Certificate of Analysis for each ingredient. Your component specification sheets document that the identity test is conducted via an in-house(b)(4)method. You did not provide documentation to support the identity specification documented via your in-house(b)(4)method. In addition, and as noted above, because the product is multi-ingredient product, we would expect the finished testing specifications to include multiple bands for each of the components that would give the respective Rf values.
Your October 2022 response also included a revised finished product specification for your Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan finished product. The identity specification for this product also only contains the test result of “Confirmed” and no quantitative data.
Your responses did not include any information regarding purity, strength, composition specifications related to the ingredients referenced above or to the finished product. You must establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met.
Furthermore, the component specification sheets in your October 2022 response document(b)(4)analysis and Fournier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis will be conducted against an “in-house reference standard which is established by outsourcing testing Labs.” You do not have an adequate identity specification because you are not conducting identity testing against a qualified reference standard. You did not provide procedures for creating a qualified reference standard. You did not provide documentation that you are creating a reference standard by obtaining reference standard material of highest purity by reasonable effort and thoroughly characterizing the material to ensure identity, purity, quality, and strength. You did not provide qualification documentation for these standards showing they have been reviewed and approved by quality control personnel prior to use.
2. Your quality control personnel failed to reject a component or dietary supplement when a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70 was not met, nor did they approve a permitted treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as required by 111.113(b)(2). Your firm’s quality control personnel also failed to conduct a material review and make a disposition decision when the established specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(a)(1). For example, your finished product testing result found(b)(4)/serving of zinc in your(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)product, lot number(b)(4), which exceeded your established finished product specification for zinc at(b)(4)(per serving or capsule). Your quality control unit did not conduct a material review and make a disposition decision that the specification was not met.
In addition, your quality control unit released the product(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), on June 28, 2022, but third-party laboratory results for microbial testing and zinc potency were not released until July 5, 2022, and July 7, 2022, respectively.
We have reviewed your responses, dated October 20, 2022, and November 7, 2022. Your October 2022 response stated that you have trained personnel on conducting investigations when specifications are not met. Your response did not describe the type of training provided or include evidence of training records demonstrating the associated personnel will be able to release components and finished products appropriately.
Your November 2022 response included an OOS [out-of-specification] Investigation Report regarding the zinc levels in(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4), lot number(b)(4). As part of this investigation, it appears that a reserve sample of(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), was tested and found to have a level of(b)(4)per capsule, which would have been within the specification. However, the investigation testing was performed using a different methodology and by a different laboratory than the laboratory which conducted the original analysis, thus making it difficult to compare the results and to verify accuracy.
3. You failed to establish master manufacturing records (MMRs) that include all required components of 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMRs for your Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan,(b)(4), and(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)products failed to include:
A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)].
The MMRs for your(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)product failed to include:
A complete list of components to be used [21 CFR 111.210(b)];
An accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)];
The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)]; • A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient [21 CFR 111.210(e)];
A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)];
Written instructions [21 CFR 111.210(h)], including the following:
o Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packed and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)].o Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)].o Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)].i. Such specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i)]; andii. For manual operations, such specific actions must include [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)]:A. One person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A)]; andB. One person adding the component and another person verifying the addition [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B)].o Special notations and precautions to be followed;o Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, the Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan,(b)(4), and(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (f)] because the product label’s front panel and dietary ingredients listed in the proprietary blend contain information in two languages but do not repeat all the required label information (including the nutrition information) in both languages. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
2. The Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
3. The Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan,(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual name (standardized common name) or Latin binomial of each ingredient (in the absence of a standardized common name perHerbs of Commerce) used as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h).
4. The Lycium Formula Huan Shao Dan and(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) the Act [21 U.S.C § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. Your Lycium Formula Huan Shao fails to place the heading, “Amount Per Serving,” above the listed quantitative amount per serving in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).
b. Your(b)(4)Zinc(b)(4)includes a footnote to the % Daily Value for zinc that specifies Recommended Daily Allowances for zinc that vary depending on different groups or persons. There is no provision in the regulation for a symbol that links to the same symbol appearing before information concerning Recommended Daily Allowances for different groups or persons. Furthermore, this Recommended Daily Allowance statement represents that this product is intended for different groups of persons. The product’s Supplement Facts label fails to list the serving size for each of the groups indicated on the label. If the product is represented for persons within more than one group, the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: 658733
Dear Naeem Azizian:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.gearisle.com, between January and July 2023, where you took orders for “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg.”1In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that samples of your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products each contain the undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients tadalafil and sildenafil. Tadalafil and sildenafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Cialis and Viagra, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates.
Information on the label and/or labeling of your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products demonstrates that these products are marketed as dietary supplements. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003, and approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that tadalafil and sildenafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as food before Cialis and Viagra were approved, your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website and product labels that establish the intended use of your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
On the “NUX Male Enhancement” label:
“SIZE increase in thickness and in length”
“NO premature ejaculation”
“EXPLOSIVE orgasm”
“ROCK hard erections”
On your webpage, www.gearisle.com/nux-male-enhancement-blue-pill for “NUX Male Enhancement”:
“No premature ejaculation”
“Better ejaculation control”
“ROCK hard erection”
On the “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement” label:
“Be FREE from PREMATURE EJACULATION”
“INCREASED Volume of Ejaculate!”
“Amazing increase in THICKNESS and INCREASES in LENGTH, WIDTH and STAMINA!”

“Last up to 12 days”
“Bigger, harder, longer erections”
“Prevents premature ejaculations”
“Increase intense stamina & sex drive”
Your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, each is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” or “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Each of your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products, which contain undeclared tadalafil and sildenafil, are also prescription drugs as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for their use. Prescription drugs can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs, including for your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products. “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA approved application in effect for these products. For these reasons, your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352.
Additionally, your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products do not declare that the products contain PDE-5 inhibitors. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product labeling renders your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your products also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for serious health risks associated with these products, particularly since anyone who takes your “NUX Male Enhancement,” “DYNAMITE Male Sexual Enhancement,” and “ProPower Knight Plus 2550mg” products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
We also documented that your websites www.gearisle.com, www.smokewrap.com, and www.ultimamax.com offer for sale variations of “Titanium 18k,” “Hard AF!,” and/or various Rhino products for sale to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA lab analyses of products similarly named to those sold on your websites revealed these products contain the undeclared ingredients sildenafil and/or tadalafil.2We also note that you offer for sale the product “Royal Honey” on your website at www.smokewrap.com. A variation of this product with the same name has been the subject of previous FDA warnings after FDA analysis confirmed the presence of an undeclared PDE-5 inhibitor.3While the Agency has not sampled and tested these product variations from your inventory to date, this letter is to express our serious concern about the safety of these products and emphasize that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that they do not contain any undeclared and potentially harmful ingredients.

WARNING LETTER
Refer to CMS 648568Bradley E. Erpelding, President and Chief Financial OfficerCody Townsend, Executive Vice President of RetailDear Messrs. Erpelding and Townsend:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your Wonky Confections, LLC facility, which manufactures ready-to-eat (RTE) human food products containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), located at 2721 20th Avenue South, Unit J, Moorhead, Minnesota, on November 8-9, 16, 28, and December 7, 2022.
Based on the inspection, a review of the product labels collected during the inspection, and laboratory analysis of your products, FDA has determined that your “Death by Gummy Bears” and “Wonky Weeds” gummy bear products you manufactured in your facility are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Additionally, we have determined that the RTE food products manufactured in your facility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4), in that they were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.
At the conclusion of the inspection FDA issued a Form FDA-483 (FDA-483), Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your facility. We also received your response dated December 19, 2022, which included a summary of corrective actions taken or planned by your firm. Based on our review of the inspectional findings and the response that your firm provided, we are issuing this letter to advise you of FDA’s concerns and to provide detailed information describing the findings at your facility.As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: (1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that puts public health at risk; (2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; (3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; (4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and (5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter informs you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Adulterated Human Foods (section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act)According to your product labeling, your “Death by Gummy Bears” and “Wonky Weeds” gummy bear products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. In addition, FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that samples of these products contain Delta-8 THC.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Death by Gummy Bears” and “Wonky Weeds” gummy bear products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
Adulterated Human Foods (section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act)Your RTE food products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4), in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby the food products may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. During our inspection of your establishment, FDA investigators found violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations for human foods under 21 CFR Part 117, subpart B. The significant violations are as follows:
1. You did not take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that all persons working in direct contact with food wash hands thoroughly (and sanitize if necessary to protect against contamination with undesirable microorganisms) after each absence from the workstation and at any other time when hands may have become soiled or contaminated, as required by 21 CFR 117.10(b)(3). Specifically, on November 8 and November 9, 2022,(b)(4)employees were observed not washing and sanitizing hands prior to donning gloves before separating by hand the RTE gummy candy products from excess sugar and hand-packing the products into finished product packaging.
In your response you stated you have implemented a(b)(4)procedure that instructs employees to wash hands in a number of situations, including but not limited to, the following situations: before starting work, before putting on or changing gloves, and after any time the hands may become contaminated. You state you have begun training employees in the new procedure, including posting signs with a step-by-step(b)(4)procedure by each(b)(4)sink. You state the process will be implemented by January 31, 2023. We will verify the adequacy of this corrective action during a future inspection.
2. You did not provide(b)(4)facilities designed to ensure that an employee's hands are not a source of contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials, by providing facilities that are adequate, convenient, and furnish running water at a suitable temperature, as required by 21 CFR 117.37(e). Specifically, your facility is equipped with only one(b)(4)sink, located in the employee restroom, which is inaccessible during bathroom occupancy and shared by approximately(b)(4)employees. This(b)(4)sink is in a separate area that is approximately(b)(4)feet away from the production area.
In your response you stated you will begin drafting plans for the installation of a new(b)(4)sink, which will be in the same room where manufacturing operations occur. Additionally, you stated you have contacted a plumber and discussed plans for the following services: installation of motion sensor operated faucets on both the current and the new(b)(4)sink and the installation of automatic soap dispensers at both(b)(4)stations. You also state that until these operations have been completed, employees will be instructed to use paper towels to turn off the faucet and open the door, if necessary. You did not provide in your response an update on the installation process or a timeline for completion, nor did you include invoices or other records demonstrating that you have been in contact with a plumber. We will verify the adequacy of this corrective action during a future inspection.
3. You did not clean food-contact surfaces in a manner that protects against allergen cross-contact and contamination, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Specifically, on November 9, 2022, employees were observed washing equipment and utensils used in the production of the RTE gummy candy products with detergent but not sanitizing them. Cleaned utensils are placed onto a metal drying rack; however, a measuring pitcher was observed on the drying rack not inverted and containing pooled water. The pitcher also contained residual material that you identified as THC distillate.
In your response you stated you would prepare, implement, and train employees on a new SOP on appropriate dishwashing and sanitizing practices. You also said the SOP will include signage placed above the three-compartment sink to remind employees to wash with detergent, rinse with warm clean water, and then sanitize and soak dishes. You stated you will also employ the use of test strips to double-check the concentration of sanitizer in the water. We will verify the adequacy of this corrective action during a future inspection.
Misbranded FoodUnder section 201(qq) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(qq), soy is considered a “major food allergen.” A food is misbranded under section 403(w) of the FD&C Act if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or adjacent to the list of ingredients, section 403(w)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A); or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, e.g., “Whey (Milk),” except the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen), section 403(w)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B).
FDA’s inspection found that during the manufacturing of your gummy products, you use Pam spray as a releasing agent, which contains the allergen “soy.” Your “Wonky Weeds” and “Death by Gummy Bears” gummy bear products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w), in that the finished product label fails to declare a major food allergen (soy).
In your response you stated that you are exploring alternatives to the use of Pam spray and that, should you continue to use Pam spray, you will ensure the use of such product and its inclusion of soy will be referenced on product labels. However, you did not provide a copy of a revised label declaring the allergen soy and, therefore, we are unable to determine the adequacy of your corrective action.
Failure to Register Food FacilityIn addition, FDA has determined that your facility located at 2721 20th Avenue South, Unit J, Moorhead, Minnesota, 56560, is subject to the food facility registration requirement in section 415 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 350d, and our implementing regulation at 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart H. Our records indicate that as of the date of this letter your facility has not been registered with FDA. The failure to register a facility as required is a prohibited act under section 301(dd) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(dd).
As a responsible official of a facility that manufactures/processes, packs, or holds food for human or animal consumption in the United States, you are responsible for ensuring that your overall operation and the products you distribute comply with the law.We request that the owner, operator, or agent in charge of this facility, or an individual authorized by this facility's owner, operator, or agent in charge, register the facility with FDA within 30 working days of the date of this letter. Food facility registration guidance is available online at https://www.fda.gov/food/guidance-regulation-food-and-dietary-supplements/registration-food-facilities-and-other-submissions. Registration may be accomplished online at http://www.access.fda.gov. You must submit your registration or registration renewal to FDA electronically, unless FDA has granted you a waiver under 21 CFR 1.245 (21 CFR 1.231(a)(4)).
ConclusionThis letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the cause(s) of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days from your receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your reply should be addressed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Compliance Officer Boun Xiong, 250 Marquette Avenue, Suite 600, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55401. If you have any questions about this letter, please contact Mr. Xiong at (414) 326-3976 or via email at boun.xiong@fda.hhs.gov.

Dear Mr. Ridenour:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address koicbd.com in June 2023 through July 2023 and has determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA also inspected your Koi CBD facility, which distributes human food products containing Delta-8, located at 14631 Best Ave, Norwalk, CA 90650, on December 12-15, 2022.
FDA has determined that your products, Koi brand “Delta 8 Gummies” and Hemp Living brand “Pot Rocks,” are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulationcannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-knowabout-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Koi brand “Delta 8 Gummies” and Hemp Living brand “Pot Rocks” are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects of Delta-8 THC on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to conventional foods is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Koi brand “Delta 8 Gummies” and Hemp Living brand “Pot Rocks” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

WARNING LETTER CMS # 648182
Dear Mr. Laudon:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your manufacturing facility located at 6399 State Route 83, Holmesville, OH from August 22 through November 9, 2022. Based on inspectional findings and subsequent review of product labels collected during the inspection, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
FDA acknowledges the receipt of the correspondences dated November 11 and December 22, 2022, and February 24, March 24, April 20, and May 16, 2023, from you and/or your consultant written in response to the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address the responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Violations of the CGMPs for the Manufacturing of Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility from August 22 through November 9, 2022, revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on these violations, your Dental Health, Honey Herbal Syrup, and Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish identity specifications for each component you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1), and you failed to establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
a. For your components, your “Eden’s Answers Raw Material Specification” sheets for catnip, chamomile, hops, oat straw, and passionflower used in the manufacture of Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time purport to establish an identity specification of “HPTLC.” However, “HPTLC” is not a qualitative or quantitative parameter to which a test result can be compared to verify the identity of the component.
b. For your finished products, your “Finished Good Specification” sheet for Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time includes the following: “Type: Liquid,” “Form: Liquid,” “Color: Amber,” and “identity: FTIR.” Specifications such as “Liquid” and “Amber” are general descriptions of the product and alone do not confirm the identity of the product. Furthermore, specifications of “Liquid,” “Amber,” and “FTIR” are not qualitative or quantitative parameters to which a test result can be compared to verify the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement.
For each of specification you are required to establish, you must take specific actions to determine whether the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We have reviewed your responses dated November 11 and December 22, 2022, and February 24, March 24, April 20, and May 16, 2023. Relating to component specifications, in your February 24, 2023, response you provided a document titled “Raw Material Specification – Lemon Balm,” an ingredient used in the manufacture of your Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time dietary supplement, and your May 16, 2023, response provided Certificates of Analysis (COAs) for ingredients used in the manufacture of your dietary supplements. The February 24, 2023, response fails to provide information pertaining to identity specifications for any of the other components used in your Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time product and does not address any of the components in your Honey Herbal Syrup and Dental Health products. The COAs provided in your May 16, 2023, similarly, you do not document that you have established the required component specifications for each ingredient used in the manufacture of your dietary supplement products.
Relating to your finished products, your December 22, 2022, response purported to provide revised finished product specifications for Dental Health and Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time, and your February 24, 2023, response purported to provide revised specifications for Honey Herbal Syrup. None of the documentation, however, demonstrates that you have established the required finished product specifications. Specifically, for Dental Health, you established an identity specification for Peppermint (Leaf), but establishing an identity specification for peppermint alone will not confirm the identity of this multi-ingredient product, and the documentation you provided does not demonstrate that you have established specifications for the purity, strength, or composition of the finished product. For your Lil’ One’s Sleepy Time, you established an identity specification for Passionflower, but establishing an identity specification for passionflower alone will not confirm the identity of this multi-ingredient product, and the documentation you provided does not demonstrate that you have established specifications for the purity, strength, or composition of the finished product. For your Honey Herbal Syrup, you established an identity specification for Licorice Root and a strength specification for menthol but establishing an identity for one ingredient and a strength specification for another ingredient in this multi-ingredient product is not sufficient to confirm the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished product.
We also note that in establishing your identity specifications, USP chapter <621> is the general chapter for Chromatography and is not a specific test to verify the identity, purity, strength, and composition of your Dental Health, Lil’ Ones Sleepy Time, and Honey Herbal Syrup products.
2. Your batch production record fails to include the date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(c). Specifically, your batch production records for Honey Herbal Syrup Batch 1470-01-003, Lil Ones Sleepy Time Batch 1615-01-002, and Natural Health Dental Health Batch 1560-01—003 fail to include the date and time of any maintenance, cleaning, sanitizing, or a cross reference to where this information is documented.
3. Your master manufacturing record fails to identify specifications and provide written instructions for such specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(b)(1) and 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1). Specifically, your master production record for Honey Herbal Syrup includes a step to(b)(4); however, this manufacturing step does not include any temperature specifications or written instructions for controls such as monitoring and recording the time and temperature.
4. Your quality control personnel failed to conduct a material review and make a disposition decision when a batch deviates from the master manufacturing record, including when any step established in the master manufacturing record is not completed and including any deviation from specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(a)(2). Specifically, your batch production record for Lil Ones Sleepy Time Batch# 1615-01-002 includes documented yield deviations from the master manufacturing record for which a quality review and disposition was not documented.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the dietary supplement products Honey Herbal Syrup and Sleepy Time that you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The Honey Herbal Syrup and Sleepy Time product labels are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size for each intended group is not declared in the Supplement Facts label.
2. The Honey Herbal Syrup and Sleepy Time product labels are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because each label does not declare the number of servings per container for each intended group in the Supplement Facts label.
3. The Honey Herbal Syrup and Sleep Time product labels are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act because the nutrition information in the Supplement Facts label is not declared for each intended group in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E). The quantitative amount of the Proprietary Blend per serving for each intended group needs to be declared.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

March 17, 2023
Dear Mr. Sayage:
Between March 29, 2022, and April 8, 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facilities located at 75 & 85 Price Parkway, Farmingdale, NY 11735-1305. The inspection of your facilities revealed significant violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products, including your(b)(4), and(b)(4)to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. You can find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
We received your correspondence dated April 25, 2022, in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, your firm's certificates of analysis for finished products(b)(4), and(b)(4)indicate assay testing was based on production input rather than on any type of analytical testing of the finished product. This was confirmed in discussions with management stating that product specifications are determined to be met based on product input during manufacturing for all products manufactured. The input of a dietary ingredient alone is not sufficient to verify its specifications and composition because the addition of a dietary ingredient into a product formulation is a manufacturing step; it is not a definitive test method that yields a measured result, nor is it able to assess the ingredient in the finished dietary supplement product when other components are present. All tests and examinations that are employed to determine whether a specification has been met must be scientifically valid in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1).
We have reviewed your response dated April 25, 2022, and find it to be inadequate because it does not include specifications and test methods for performing microbiological testing for pathogenic microbes, which is required under 21 CFR 111.75(c). We note your corrective action plans for implementing the use of(b)(4)to test presence and strength of active ingredients for all finished products, installation of a(b)(4), creation/improvement of procedures and personnel training.
2. Your firm failed to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, prior to its use, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii), which you have not, and the agency exempts you from such testing. Specifically, you failed to verify the identity of:
Dietary ingredients Zembrin (Sceletium tortuosum (aerial parts) extract) Lot(b)(4)and Agmatine Sulfate Lot(b)(4)before they were used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 0723;
Dietary ingredient Camellia Sinensis Extract (leaf) (Epicatechin) Lot(b)(4)before it was used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 0723;
Dietary ingredient Betaine HCl Lot(b)(4)before it was used to manufacture thefinished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 05/2024;
Dietary ingredient Organic Chaga Mushroom Extract (Inonotus obliquus) Lot(b)(4)before it was used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 04/2024; and
Dietary ingredients Zinc (as Zinc Gluconate) Lot(b)(4), Echinacea Purpurea Lot(b)(4), and Elderberry Fruit Extract (as Sambucus Nigra) Lot(b)(4)before they were used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 06/2022.
Discussions with management during our inspection confirmed that no testing is conducted on new dietary ingredients when they are first received by your firm. Instead, your firm uses(b)(4)and(b)(4)to test these ingredients and then use the results as the standard moving forward.
We have reviewed your response dated April 25, 2022, and we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. We note your corrective action plan for incoming raw materials is to purchase a scientific database to obtain standards for botanicals and to obtain physical standards and testing on your equipment to build a library.
3. Your quality control personnel failed to reject a component or dietary supplement when that component or dietary supplement failed to meet an established specification; nor did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing that would ensure the quality of the finished dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement was packaged and labeled as specified in your master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.77(a) and 111.113(b)(2). Specifically, your firm’s stated specification for(b)(4)and(b)(4)identity testing is(b)(4)when compared to(b)(4). The following ingredients did not meet this specification and were used to manufacture finished dietary supplement products without any documentation relaying QC investigation:
Dietary supplement ingredient Ashwagandha Powder Lot(b)(4)did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 8/09/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. The dietary supplement ingredient Ginseng Powder Lot(b)(4)also did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 8/09/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. Both of these ingredients were used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 0723.
Dietary supplement ingredient Triacetyuridine Powder, Lot(b)(4)did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 08/19/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. This ingredient tested again on 8/19/21 did not meet your established specification with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. A second dietary supplement ingredient Phosphatidylserine from Sunflower 50% Lot(b)(4), did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 8/19/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. A third dietary supplement ingredient Synapsa Powder Lot(b)(4)did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 8/19/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail” and again on this date with a correlation of(b)(4). All three of these ingredients were used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 0723.
Dietary supplement ingredient 7,8 Dihydroxyflavone (DHF) Powder Lot(b)(4)did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 08/26/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. This dietary supplement ingredient tested again on this date with a failing correlation of(b)(4). A second dietary supplement ingredient Lion’s Mane Powder Lot(b)(4)did not meet your established specification during(b)(4)testing on 08/10/2021 with a correlation of(b)(4)and was labeled “Fail”. These ingredients were used to manufacture the finished dietary supplement product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), Exp 0723.
We have reviewed your response, dated April 25, 2022, and we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. We note your corrective action plans to revise SOPs QC-EU-005.01 “Operation, & Cleaning(b)(4)” & QC-EU-003.01 “Operation, and Cleaning(b)(4)” to add a calibration section and add more information on acceptable correlations and what to do if a correlation is below the acceptable limit. We also note your QC/QA meeting held on this subject. However, these corrective actions do not specifically address the out-of-specification (OOS) results noted above. In addition, an evaluation of revised and QC approved SOPs could not be conducted since they were not submitted with the response.
4. Your firm failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, for use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, you do not have the proper laboratory controls in place to conduct appropriate testing or examination to verify the identity of a component that is a dietary ingredient prior to its use. You told our investigator that the first time an ingredient is received,(b)(4)and(b)(4)testing is conducted, and the results are used as your firm’s standard moving forward. This is not a scientifically valid method in creating a referenced standard.
We have reviewed your response dated April 25, 2022, and we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. We note your corrective action plan for this observation is the same as that conveyed for Form FDA 483, observation #1. The(b)(4)you purchased is acceptable for some materials and not acceptable for others.
5. Your firm failed to follow written procedures for calibrating instruments and controls that you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR111.25(a). Specifically, your Standard Operating Procedure, “Setup and Operation(b)(4),” SOP #: QC-EU-004.02, Date Issued: 07/22/2021 states, “The instrument optical reader needs to be calibrated(b)(4).” Your firm is conducting this calibration approximately every(b)(4).
We have reviewed your response, dated April 25, 2022, and we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. We note your corrective action plans to revise SOP QC-EU-004.02 “Setup and Operation of the Soleris Next Generation System” to add a requirement to print and sign calibration reports every 30 days. We also note your QC/QA meeting held on this subject. However, an evaluation of the revised and QC approved SOP could not be conducted since it was not submitted with the response.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

WARNING LETTER
RE: 648877
Dear Ms. Etienne:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.exclusivehempfarms.com and www.oshipt.com in February 2023 and June 2023, respectively, and have determined that you take orders for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Customers place orders for these products on Oshipt.com and receive the orders from Exclusive Hemp Farms (EHF). FDA has determined that your Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg, Cannaa Banana Delta 8 - Rope Candy 600mg - 7 Flavors, Pot Tarts Strawberry 1000mg - Medicated, Tropical Sour Patch - Delta-8 500mg, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chip Cookies - 600mg Medicated, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chunky Cookies - 600mg Medicated, and Medicated Cheddar Snack Crackers 600mg – Medicated products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (e.g., candy, chips, and beverages) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1As noted in the warning, the agency received over 125 adverse event reports from January 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, related to children and adults who consumed edible products containing THC. Ten of the reports specifically mention the edible product to be a copycat of popular foods. Your Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg, Cannaa Banana Delta 8 - Rope Candy 600mg - 7 Flavors, Pot Tarts Strawberry 1000mg - Medicated, Tropical Sour Patch - Delta-8 500mg, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chip Cookies - 600mg Medicated, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chunky Cookies - 600mg Medicated, and Medicated Cheddar Snack Crackers 600mg – Medicated may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg, Cannaa Banana Delta 8 - Rope Candy 600mg - 7 Flavors, Pot Tarts Strawberry 1000mg - Medicated, Tropical Sour Patch - Delta-8 500mg, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chip Cookies - 600mg Medicated, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chunky Cookies - 600mg Medicated, and Medicated Cheddar Snack Crackers 600mg – Medicated products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. Furthermore, your Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg is labeled with a Nutrition Facts panel which is more likely to be confused for a genuine food or snack product.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg, Cannaa Banana Delta 8 - Rope Candy 600mg - 7 Flavors, Pot Tarts Strawberry 1000mg - Medicated, Tropical Sour Patch - Delta-8 500mg, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chip Cookies - 600mg Medicated, Trips Ahoy Medicated – Real Chocolate Chunky Cookies - 600mg Medicated, and MedicatedCheddar Snack Crackers 600mg – Medicated products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of FDA’s concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 648877” in the subject line of your email.
Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed your online marketing of Delta-8 THC products. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended toInt’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984));see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, you have marketed various Delta-8 THC products with an appearance and form similar to conventional foods and candies often consumed by children. For example, you have advertised Oreo Stoneo – Medicated 500mg in packaging resembling that for Nabisco Oreo Double Stuf chocolate cookies, using the same blue background, a red triangle in the upper lefthand corner reading “DABISCO” in the style of the Nabisco logo, and a depiction of a crème-filled chocolate sandwich cookie with a splash of milk. Also, you have marketed Medicated Cheddar Snack Crackers 600mg in packaging using the Cheez-It logo including a depiction of what appear to be Cheez-It crackers. Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy
Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended toCliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3 Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov with 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

WARNING LETTER
RE: 649469
Dear Mr. Villalobos:
This letter is to advise you that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.agrodine.com and www.cbdwarehouseusa.com in January 2023, May 2023, and June 2023, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Customers place orders for these products on Agrodine.com and cbdwarehouseusa.com and are charged by Nikte’s Wholesale, LLC. FDA has determined that your Delta-8 Gushers, Delta-8 THC Lemonade 500mg, Medicated Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour, and Delta-8 THC Hot Cheetos products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children.See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in forms (e.g., candy, chips, and beverages) that are appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1As noted in the warning, the agency received over 125 adverse event reports from January 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, related to children and adults who consumed edible products containing THC. Ten of the reports specifically mention the edible product to be a copycat of popular foods. Your Delta 8 THC Gushers, Delta 8 THC Lemonade 500mg, Medicated Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour, and Delta 8 THC Hot Cheetos THC products are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Delta 8 THC Gushers, Delta-8 THC Lemonade 500mg, Medicated Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour, and Delta 8 THC Hot Cheetos THC products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. Furthermore, your Delta-8 THC Lemonade 500mg and your Delta 8 THC Hot Cheetos products are labeled with a Nutrition Facts panel which are more likely to be confused for a genuine beverage or drink product.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Delta 8 THC Gushers, Delta-8 THC Lemonade 500mg, Medicated Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour, and Delta 8 THC Hot Cheetos products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of FDA’s concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 649469” in the subject line of your email.
Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended to Int’l Harvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984));see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your various Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to conventional candies, foods, and beverages often consumed by children. For instance, your Delta-8 Sour Gushers product is marketed in packaging that strongly resembles the packaging for Super Sour Gushers fruit snacks, including: a yellow background; brightly-colored design elements evoking liquid splotches, including green elements at the top and bottom; and the depiction of several individual fruit snacks, including a red fruit snack gushing red liquid beneath the word “Gushers.” Your Delta-8 THC Hot Cheetos are marketed in packaging that resembles the packaging for Cheetos Crunchy Xxtra Flamin’ Hot Cheese Flavored Snacks, using the same black and orange color scheme, the use of the Cheetos name and logo, and a depiction of flames at the top and bottom of the package. Your Medicated Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour are marketed in packaging that resembles the packaging of Jolly Rancher Gummies candies and Jolly Rancher Gummies Sour candies, including the use of a blue background, the use of the Jolly Rancher Gummies name and logo, and the cartoon depiction of anthropomorphic fruits.
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended toCliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov with 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

RE: 648878
Dear Mrs. Barton:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.njvaporroom.com in February 2023 and June 2023, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Rope 500mg Delta-8 Nerds Candy, Medicated Dope Rope Bites, Packwoods x Coned Delta-8 Edible Cones – 600mg, Cake 500mg Delta-8 Gummy Pack, and Candy’s D8 Chocolate Bars 500mg products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive.

Dear Mr. Hoang:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.deltamunchies.com in March 2023 and June 2023, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Sour Worms – 625mg Delta-8 THC, Gummy Bears – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Strawberry Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Peach Rings – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Berry Blue Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Green Apple Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Watermelon Gummies – 450mg Delta-8 THC, and Sour Bites – 450mg Delta-8 THC products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

FDA has observed a proliferation of products containing the cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in a form (e.g., candy) that is appealing to children, that mimic well-known snack food brands by using similar brand names, logos, or pictures on packaging, and that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the Delta-8 THC ingredient by consumers. In June 2022, FDA warned consumers about the accidental ingestion by children of food products containing THC.1As noted in the warning, the agency received over 125 adverse event reports from January 1, 2021, through May 31, 2022, related to children and adults who consumed edible products containing THC. Ten of the reports specifically mention the edible product to be a copycat of popular foods. Your Sour Worms – 625mg Delta-8 THC, Gummy Bears – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Strawberry Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Peach Rings – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Berry Blue Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Green Apple Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Watermelon Gummies – 450mg Delta-8 THC, and Sour Bites – 450mg Delta-8 THC products are all in forms that may be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children.
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your Sour Worms – 625mg Delta-8 THC, Gummy Bears – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Strawberry Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Peach Rings – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Berry Blue Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Green Apple Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Watermelon Gummies – 450mg Delta-8 THC, and Sour Bites – 450mg Delta-8 THC products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added. Furthermore, all of the above Delta-8 THC products are labeled with a Nutrition Facts panel which are more likely to be confused for genuine food or snack products.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Sour Worms – 625mg Delta-8 THC, Gummy Bears – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Strawberry Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Peach Rings – 450mg Delta-8 THC, Berry Blue Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Green Apple Sour Belts – 3000mg Delta-8 THC, Watermelon Gummies – 450mg Delta-8 THC, and Sour Bites – 450mg Delta-8 THC products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.This letter notifies you of FDA’s concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 656322” in the subject line of your email.
Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended toInt’lHarvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984));see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your various Delta-8 THC gummy products have an appearance and form similar to conventional gummy candies often consumed by children. The brightly colored packaging includes depictions of the gummy products in fruity and sour flavors that enhance their appeal to children and increases the likelihood that children will ingest these products as candies. Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading. FTC Policy Statement on Deception, 103 F.T.C. 174, 176 n.9 (1984) (appended toCliffdale Assocs., Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110 (1984)) (the nature, appearance, or intended use of a product may create an impression in the mind of the consumer, and it is deceptive if this impression is false and not corrected by the seller); 15 U.S.C. §§ 52, 55(a)(1) (under Section 12 of the FTC Act, which prohibits false advertisements for foods and drugs, the Commission must consider any consequences that may result from the use of the product under customary or usual conditions).
Children are at particular risk for mistakenly ingesting edible THC products imitating traditional foods because they are more likely to focus on similarities of product appearance and packaging, and less likely to notice or be able to comprehend labeling text. Ingesting edible cannabis products can result in serious health consequences in children.3Given the significant number of adverse events reported in connection with ingestion of edible products containing THC, advertising and packaging your Delta-8 THC gummy products in a manner that is likely to be particularly appealing to young children could present an unwarranted risk to health and safety.
You must immediately cease marketing edible Delta-8 THC products that imitate conventional foods using advertising or packaging that is likely to be appealing to young children. The FTC also strongly urges you to review all of your marketing and product packaging for similar edible THC products, and to take swift and appropriate steps to protect consumers, especially young children.
With regard to the FTC-related issues described in this letter, please notify Christine DeLorme, attorney with the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at cdelorme@ftc.gov with 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Ms. DeLorme at (202) 326-2095.

WARNING LETTER
RE: 648825
Dear Mr. Mansi:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.drsmoke.com in December 2022 and June 2023, respectively, and have determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). FDA has determined that your Cheetos Crunchy Flamin’ Hot THC Infused Chips and Doritos Nacho Cheese THC Infused Chips are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce adulterated food into interstate commerce under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/publichealth- focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.

Unfair or Deceptive Marketing
In addition, the FTC has reviewed the online marketing of the Delta-8 THC products referenced above. Section 5 of the FTC Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce. This prohibition includes practices that present unwarranted health or safety risks. Commission Policy Statement on Unfairness, 104 F.T.C. 1070, 1071 (1984) (appended toInt’lHarvester Co., 104 F.T.C. 949 (1984));see also Philip Morris, Inc., 82 F.T.C. 16 (1973) (alleging that distribution of sample razor blades without protective packaging in home-delivered newspapers was a health and safety hazard, particularly to young children, that violated Section 5). Preventing practices that present unwarranted health and safety risks, particularly to children, is one of the Commission’s highest priorities. FTC Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2022-2026 at 5.
As noted above, your Delta-8 THC products have an appearance and form similar to conventional snack foods often consumed by children. Your THC-infused “Doritos” are marketed in packaging that is nearly identical to that of Doritos Nacho Cheese Flavored Tortilla Chips, including use of the same red background, the use of Doritos name and triangle logo, and the depiction of two tortilla chips in the same position. Likewise, your THC-infused “Cheetos” are marketed in packaging that is nearly identical to that of Cheetos Crunchy Flamin’ Hot Cheese Flavored Snacks, including a red, yellow, and orange color scheme, the use of the Cheetos name and logo, a depiction of the Cheetos mascot Chester Cheetah, and a very similar font and color used for the flavor name “Flamin’ Hot.”
Imitating non-THC-containing food products often consumed by children through the use of advertising or labeling is misleading.

RE: 657631
Dear Humberto Cecena:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://suprimoimports.com/, in January and April 2023, where you took orders for “AK Forte” and “Bob Marley CannaKing.” In addition, FDA has obtained a sample and labeling of your “AK Forte” product. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “AK Forte” contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients diclofenac, dexamethasone, and methocarbamol.1Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions. Corticosteroid use can impair a person’s ability to fight infections and can cause high blood sugar levels, muscle injuries and psychiatric problems. When corticosteroids are taken for a prolonged period, or at high doses, they can suppress the adrenal gland. Abrupt discontinuation can cause withdrawal symptoms. In addition, the undeclared dexamethasone in “AK Forte” may cause serious side effects when combined with other medications.
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (commonly referred to as NSAIDs). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. The undeclared diclofenac ingredient in “AK Forte” may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Methocarbamol is a muscle relaxant that can cause sedation, dizziness, and low blood pressure. Methocarbamol can also impair mental and physical abilities to perform certain tasks, such as driving a motor vehicle or operating machinery.
Information on the label and/or labeling of “AK Forte” demonstrates that the product is marketed as a dietary supplement.2Under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), if an article is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.
FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988 and dexamethasone, under the trade name Hexadrol, as a new drug on December 21, 1960. Given that diclofenac and dexamethasone were not marketed as dietary supplements or as food before Voltaren and Hexadrol were approved, “AK Forte,” which contains diclofenac and dexamethasone, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
“AK Forte” and “Bob Marley CannaKing” products are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and product labeling of “AK Forte” and “Bob Marley CannaKing” that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“AK Forte” and “Bob Marley CannaKing” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “AK Forte” and “Bob Marley CannaKing.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 301(d), 21 U.S.C. 331(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act.Misbranded Drugs
Your “AK Forte” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “AK Forte” does not declare that the product contains the drug ingredients diclofenac, dexamethasone and methocarbamol. As discussed earlier, diclofenac can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, or serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines, or liver toxicity including liver failure that can cause the need for a liver transplant or death. Dexamethasone can cause serious adverse events, including infections, increased blood glucose levels, changes in blood pressure, damage to bones, psychiatric problems, and adrenal dysfunction. Methocarbamol can cause sedation, dizziness, and low blood pressure. The failure to disclose the presence of diclofenac, dexamethasone and methocarbamol in the product’s labeling renders “AK Forte” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
In addition, your “Bob Marley CannaKing” is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). “Bob Marley CannaKing” is offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, “Bob Marley CannaKing” is not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for these products.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
We also documented that you offer the product “Artri Ajo King” for sale to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA laboratory analysis of “Artri Ajo King” revealed that it contains the undeclared ingredient, diclofenac.3On April 20, 2022, FDA warned consumers not to purchase or use “Artri Ajo King” as FDA has received adverse event reports, including of liver toxicity and death, associated with the use of “Artri Ajo King” and similarly named products.4While the Agency has not sampled and tested this product from your inventory to date, be advised of our serious concern about the safety of these products and that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure this product does not contain any undeclared and potentially harmful ingredients.
A full list of all tainted products discovered by FDA can be found at https://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/health-fraud-product-database.
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
We offer the following additional comments:
Information on the label and/or labeling of “Bob Marley CannaKing” demonstrates that the product is marketed as dietary supplement. For example, the product is labeled as a “Dietary Supplement.” FDA has concluded that, based on available evidence, CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), because, based on available evidence, CBD was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized.5FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Please submit a written response to this letter within fifteen working days from the date of receipt, explaining the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within fifteen working days from the date of receipt of this letter.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

5CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

Dear Ms. Li Xu:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://d-calusa.com/ and your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/dcalusa/ and https://www.facebook.com/mfitsupps/ in April 2023 and has determined that you take orders at https://d-calusa.com/ for the product Chewable Calcium 600MG with Vitamin D for Kids in Orange Flavor. The claims on your websites establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your Chewable Calcium 600MG with Vitamin D for Kids in Orange Flavor product is intended for use as a drug include:
On the website https://d-calusa.com/ home page in the linked article titled: “VITAMIN D & IT’S BENEFITS”:
“But, by upping your vitamin D levels, you can help re-mineralize bone structures, making them stronger…It could also help prevent osteoporosis, a condition affecting over 53 million people...Some studies have found that vitamin D can actually slow down bone loss, warding off osteoporosis and keeping you stronger for longer.”
“[Vitamin D] can protect against gum disease…Researchers recently discovered that low vitamin D levels are linked to periodontitis, or gum disease. Their study found those with chronic gum disease also had very low levels of vitamin D in the blood.”
“Vitamin D reduces depression…Research has shown that vitamin D might play an important role in regulating mood and warding off depression. In one study, scientists found that people with depression who received vitamin D supplements noticed an improvement in their symptoms.”
On the website https://d-calusa.com/ Health & Wellness page in the linked article titled: “CALCIUM DEFICIENCY|LOW CALCIUM SYMPTOMS”:
“How to Prevent Hypocalcemia?...The safest and easiest way to prevent hypocalcemia is by incorporating more calcium to your diet…For those who can’t meet their calcium recommended daily intake through their diets alone, calcium supplements are highly effective at maintaining healthy calcium levels…In addition, sometimes taking vitamin D supplements may be necessary to increase the absorption of calcium in the digestive tract.”
On the website https://d-calusa.com/ Health & Wellness page in the linked article titled: “WHAT IS CALCIUM? | CALCIUM BENEFITS”:
“[C]alcium supplements are tied to several health benefits including…lowering the risk of colon cancer…”
“Calcium supplements are the standard defense-mechanism for treating and preventing bone-related diseases such as osteoporosis.”
On the website https://d-calusa.com/ Health & Wellness page in the linked article titled: “CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE WITH THESE KEY MINERALS”:
“Last, but not least, there’s a strong link between healthy calcium levels and controlled blood pressure. Besides being the cornerstone of bone health, calcium has many extended benefits, and lowering blood pressure is one of them. When combined with magnesium, calcium plays a critical role when it comes to regulating the constriction and dilatation of blood vessels. Research suggests calcium can help control high blood pressure, as it has been shown in several clinical trials that indicate increased calcium intake is linked to lower blood pressure and lower risk of hypertension. Previous studies have noted a reduction in systolic blood pressure as well as diastolic blood pressure per 100 mg of calcium consumed daily.”
On the website https://d-calusa.com/ FAQs page:
“How much calcium do I need if I suffer from osteopenia?...If you suffer from osteopenia, you need between 1,000 and 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day, but, you also need 800 international units (IU) of vitamin D per day to help strengthen bones and treat your symptoms.”
“Do I need calcium for hair growth?... Low levels of vitamin D are associated with alopecia or hair loss. Adding vitamin D and calcium supplements may help create new hair follicles, which can play a role in hair growth.”
On the social media site at https://www.facebook.com/dcalusa/ which directs consumers to your website to https://d-calusa.com/ to purchase your products, including Chewable Calcium 600MG with Vitamin D for Kids in Orange Flavor:
Post dated June 28, 2021: “What happens if a child doesn't get enough vitamin D? Children who don't get enough vitamin D may not grow as much as others their age. They also have a chance of getting a rare disease called rickets, which causes bone pain and soft, weak bones that can lead to bone deformities…Follow us D-Cal for facts and tips about healthy lifestyles to stay strong!...#dcal#dcalkids”

Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product Chewable Calcium 600MG with Vitamin D for Kids in Orange Flavor is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, Chewable Calcium 600MG with Vitamin D for Kids in Orange Flavor fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

Dear Mr. Bast:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, EarthLab, Inc., DBA Wise Women Herbals, located at 185 North Mill Street, Creswell, Oregon, from April 4 to April 14, 2022. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your websites www.wisewomanherbals.com and www.facebook.com/WiseWoman Herbals, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs
We reviewed your website at www.wisewomanherbals.com in September and November 2022, and we determined you take orders for your products Green Tea Solid Extract, Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmeric, PSA Capsules, Healthy Prostate, Turmeric Gold Capsules, Joint Support, Upper Respiratory Support, and Elderberry Plus Syrup. We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/WiseWoman Herbals in September and November 2022, and we determined you direct consumers from your social media website to your website at www.wisewomanherbals.com, where you take orders for those products.
The claims on your websites establish these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Green Tea Solid Extracthttps://wisewomanherbals.com/blogs/news/supplements-for-stroke-preventions-helpreduce-stroke-risk
“Studies also show that green and black tea are helpful. Drinking three cups or more daily can reduce stroke risk by as much as 21% . . .. The antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties in tea help prevent intracerebral hemorrhages from occurring. It is believed that compounds such as catechins also provide some protection against strokes.
Another option is to consider a green tea solid extract, which can also be used as a tea concentrate.”
Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmerichttps://wisewomanherbals.com/blogs/news/supplements-for-stroke-preventions-helpreduce-stroke-risk
“Can Turmeric Help Reduce the Risk of Strokes?
Curcumin, which is extracted from turmeric, may reduce the risk factors of stroke by reducing total cholesterol and improving vascular function . . .. In a study done on stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats, curcumin delayed the onset of stroke and increased the rats’ survival time. Curcumin also increased relaxation of carotid artery response. All these factors help reduce stroke risk.”
PSA Capsuleshttps://wisewomanherbals.com/blogs/news/top-5-mens-health-supplements-for-mens-health-month
“PSA Capsules contain a blend of adaptogenic herbs like reishi…
The reishi mushroom, also known as ganoderma lucidum, has been shown to have anticancer effects, especially in those with prostate cancer. It does this primarily by suppressing the migration and invasion of prostate cancer cells.”Healthy Prostate
“Healthy Prostate … includes herbs like saw palmetto, cleavers, pipsissewa, and stinging nettle . . .. Pipsissewa is another herb that can benefit men by ... promoting anti-inflammation that can benefit the prostate glands.”
Turmeric Gold Capsuleshttps://wisewomanherbals.com/blogs/news/how-to-improve-your-joint-health-naturally
“… if you suffer from chronic joint pain, then you know how simple activities like walking, using a computer or even carrying grocery bags can become daunting and unenjoyable. In this article we’re going to dive deep into what joint pain is and how you can improve your joint pain with natural herbal remedies and supplements”
“Another way to naturally improve joint pain is to incorporate certain supplements and herbal remedies into your daily health regimen. Wise Woman Herbals Turmeric Gold Capsules are a great option for those looking for a natural alternative to over-the-counter pain relievers. In fact, studies show that turmeric is just as – if not more – effective in reducing inflammation and joint pain than NSAIDs”
“Turmeric contains the active compound curcuminoid, which when taken in a therapeutic dose can support joint comfort, maintain joint mobility and even improve digestive health by acting on our inflammation response pathways”
“[A] 2016 study showed that taking a high dose of 1000 mg of curcumin each day for an average of 8-12 weeks helped reduce inflammation and joint pain.”
Upper Respiratory Supporthttps://www.facebook.com/WiseWomanHerbals (April 28, 2022)
“[T]hyme [an ingredient in Upper Respiratory Support] has been shown to exhibit antimicrobial … anti-carcinogenesis, anti-inflammatory … properties.”
“[T]hyme is a strong antimicrobial that can help promote relief and healing from sore throats and other respiratory infections. It is why you’ll see this healing herb in Wise Woman Herbals Upper Respiratory Support tincture.”
Elderberry Plus Syruphttps://www.facebook.com/WiseWomanHerbals/ (January 26, 2020)
“In a study aimed to determine the mechanism of action of elderberry and its primary active compound, cyanidin 3-glucoside (cyn 3-glu), against influenza virus, elderberry exhibited multiple modes of therapeutic action against influenza infection.”
“The Study showed that Elderberry extract is effective in treatment of flu.”https://wisewomanherbals.com/blogs/news/supplements-for-stroke-preventions-help-reduce-stroke-risk
“Studies show that increasing vitamin C [an ingredient in Elderberry Plus Syrup] can reduce stroke risk.”
Your social media website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Joint Support for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Specifically:
Joint Supporthttps://www.facebook.com/WiseWomanHerbals/ (July 20, 2021)

Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Green Tea Solid Extract, Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmeric, PSA Capsules, and Elderberry Plus Syrup are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Green Tea Solid Extract, Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmeric, PSA Capsules, and Elderberry Plus Syrup fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
FDA’s above-mentioned inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the inspection, we determined that these violations cause certain of your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, even if your Elderberry Plus Syrup and your Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmeric were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, they would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. Your firm failed to establish a specification for every point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, you have not established certain required written specifications for the components you use in your dietary supplement products or for the finished dietary supplement products. As required by 21 CFR 111.70, you must (among other requirements):
a. Establish an identity specification for each component used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). You do not maintain written specifications for dietary ingredients such as Vitamin C and Zinc for your Elderberry Plus Syrup product. In addition, your purported identity specifications for the dietary ingredients Kava Kava Root (Piper methysticum) andEchinacea purpureaDry Root Powder, ingredients in your Kava Capsules and Echinacea Glycerite products, respectively, state the ingredients must have a “chemical identification” of “>(b)(4)%”; however, such chemical identification cannot confirm the identity of the components at issue because near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR), which you use to analyze samples, requires establishing different standards of wavelength and absorption for different components and materials to support distinctions within and between components and materials. Such a standard can be represented by a reference chromatogram that has been characterized. Your purported identity specifications for Kava Kava Root (Piper methysticum) andEchinacea purpureaDry Root Powder do not contain reference standards; therefore, they cannot confirm the identity of the ingredients at issue.
b. Establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, you do not have such component specifications for your dietary ingredients Kava Kava Root (Piper methysticum) andEchinacea purpureaDry Root Powder as you do not have any purity, strength, and composition specifications for Kava Capsules or Echinacea Glycerite, the finished products that respectively use those dietary ingredients.
c. Establish product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). For example:
Your purported finished product specifications for your Curcuma Spp. Organic Turmeric, Elderberry Plus Syrup, Kava Capsules, Echinacea Glycerite, Goldenseal (Hydrastis) Glycerite and Ginkgo biloba Liquid Extract state that the product must have a “chemical identification” of >(b)(4)%, and you purport to use NIR to confirm the identity of the finished product. However, identification by NIR requires establishing different standards of wavelength and absorption for different components and materials to support distinctions within and between components and materials. Such a standard can be represented by a reference chromatogram that has been characterized. Your purported specifications for the above finished products do not contain reference standards; therefore, they cannot confirm the identity of the finished product. Even if your purported specification could confirm the identity of the finished product, we also note inconsistencies in your records for the purported specification. For example, for your Kava Capsules product, your document titled “Confidential Finished Product Specification” states the chemical identification is a minimum value of(b)(4)%, a target value of(b)(4)%, and a maximum value of(b)(4)%. However, your document titled, “QC Laboratory (QCL) Report” states “NIR Identification - Specification(b)(4)%.” Further, your document titled “Quality Testing Matrix” states “NIR: >(b)(4)%.” It is unclear what you intend this specification to be.
Your purported finished product specifications failed to include specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of your finished dietary supplement. For example, your Elderberry Plus Syrup product is formulated to contain Vitamin C, Zinc, elder (berry), echinacea pur. (root), echinacea ang. (root) and osha (root); however, you have not established specifications for the purity, strength, and composition in the finished batch of dietary supplement.
You stated that for the approximately(b)(4)finished liquid herbal products manufactured at your facility, none have specifications for purity, strength, or composition.
Once you have established specifications as required by 21 CFR 111.70, you must verify that the established specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75. You must also make and keep records for established specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1). With regard to your component and finished product identity specification, to the extent you establish identity specifications that are capable of confirming the identity of the components and/or finished products at issue through the use of NIR or other laboratory procedures, you must also establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, including the use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, to determine whether your specifications are met (21 CFR 111.315(d)).
We have reviewed your responses dated May 5, 2022, June 6, 2022, July 6, 2022, August 8, 2022, and September 23, 2022. In your response dated June 6, 2022, you provided copies of the Quality Testing Matrix for Ascorbic Acid and Zinc Picolinate as a raw material specification, and the draft Finished Product Testing Against Specification Sheets (FTPASS) for Elderberry Plus Syrup and Potassium Sorbate Solution as a finished good specification. You subsequently stated in your response dated July 6, 2022, that your raw material specification template will be applied to your other materials. Further, you stated in your responses dated July 6, 2022, August 8, 2022, and September 23, 2022, that the implementation of your finished good specifications is still ongoing. We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide documentation to support that you have established and made effective the required component and finished product specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(a), (b), and (e).
2. Your quality control personnel neither rejected a component or dietary supplement when that component or dietary supplement failed to meet a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70, nor did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing as permitted in 21 CFR 111.77, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). Specifically:
a. You established a component specification on microbial load to limit contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch of a dietary supplement. In 2016, your firm received a shipment of Kava root, lot number(b)(4), that failed to meet your microbial load specification for Total Plate Count (TPC). TPC testing for this material resulted in 1,285,000 cfu/gram, exceeding your specification of <(b)(4)cfu/gram. Your quality control unit failed to reject this component. In addition, the quality control unit did not approve a treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing that would have ensured the quality of the finished supplement. Instead, you reassigned it to lot numbers(b)(4)and(b)(4)and subsequently incorporated it into various finished products, including certain lots of Kava Glycerite and Kava Capsules.
b. You established component specifications on lead to limit contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch of a dietary supplement. Your incoming dietary ingredients failed to meet established specification for lead as a contaminant; however, your quality control personnel failed to reject the component or approve a treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as permitted in 21 CFR 111.77. Examples include, but are not limited to, the following:
YourRuscus aculeatusroot powder lot number(b)(4)testing resulted in 1.45 ppm of lead, exceeding your specification limit of(b)(4)ppm. You also did not approve a treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing of the root powder that would have ensured the quality of the finished supplement. This ingredient was used to produce Bottoms Up Capsules lot number 17893, which was subsequently distributed to your customers.
YourRuscus aculeatusroot powder lot number(b)(4)testing resulted in 1.91 ppm of lead, exceeding your specification limit of(b)(4)ppm. You also did not approve a treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing of the root powder that would have ensured the quality of the finished supplement. This ingredient was used to produce Bottoms Up Capsules lot numbers 17972, and 18083, and lot number 17972 was subsequently distributed to your customers.
YourEchinacea purpurearoot powder lot number(b)(4)testing resulted in 1.40 ppm of lead, exceeding your specification limit of(b)(4)ppm. You also did not approve a treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing of the root powder that would have ensured the quality of the finished supplement. This ingredient was used to produce GI Caps lot numbers 17975 and 17706, which were subsequently distributed to your customers.
We have reviewed your responses dated May 5, 2022, June 6, 2022, July 6, 2022, August 8, 2022, and September 23, 2022. In response to the FDA sample results, you recalled certain lot numbers of Kava Capsules as well as various other finished products made from the Kava root component. You stated in your response dated June 6, 2022, that you will conduct a material review for microbial and heavy metals limits for your over(b)(4)raw materials that will be completed by January 2023. You also stated in your response dated June 6, 2022, that your internal review identified the materials that were improperly released with OOS results, and that you have destroyed these materials as of May 4, 2022. However, we cannot fully evaluate the adequacy of these corrective actions because you did not provide a summary of the materials identified, a summary of which (if any) finished products contained such materials, and documented proof of destruction for the components or finished product destroyed. Further, you stated in your response dated June 6, 2022, that you have issued a directive that no OOS material will be used unless a “valid rework” is found. However, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of this corrective action because you also did not include in your procedures how you plan to evaluate rejected ingredients and you have not established criteria for “valid rework.”
3. You failed to follow written procedures for laboratory operations, including written procedures for the tests and examinations that you conduct to determine whether specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.303. Specifically, you have established a standard operating procedure (SOP) titled Micro Testing: Quantification for quantifying and documenting results of your microbiological program. This procedure states that initial OOS results should be confirmed by analyzing(b)(4). You did not adhere to this procedure in conducting retesting of OOS test results of TPC testing of your Kava Capsules lot number 17764 obtained on July 22, 2021. Your retesting procedure included testing(b)(4)of the product, but you did not retest(b)(4), as required by your written procedure.
We have reviewed your responses dated May 5, 2022, June 6, 2022, July 6, 2022, August 8, 2022, and September 23, 2022. You stated in your response dated May 5, 2022, that your Micro Testing: Quantification SOP conflicts with another SOP titled Deviations and Investigations, which instructed to retest the(b)(4)that yielded the OOS result. You also stated that you would update your SOPs to ensure they would no longer conflict. In your response dated June 6, 2022, you provided your revised written procedure for Micro Testing: Quantification, which now instructs staff to reference your Deviations and Investigations SOP when OOS results are received. We acknowledge your revised written procedure; however, your response does not address what actions you have taken with personnel to prevent reoccurrence.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment: You are conducting identity tests by NIR on your multi-ingredient finished products; however, the NIR does not identify the dietary ingredients that are present in the finished product. For example, you conducted identity tests by NIR for Immune Glycerite lot number 17921, which is a multi-ingredient dietary supplement product. This product’s finished product specification states that it contains Echinacea Glycerite,(b)(4), Eriodictyon Glycerite, Hydrastis Glycerite, Ligusticum Glycerite, Verbascum Glycerite, Zingiber Glycerite, and Bitter Orange Essential Oil. However, the NIR material report does not show this. You must verify that NIR and the associated method is appropriate for its intended use, as required by 21 CFR 111.320(a).
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021-4421, to the attention of Mark Babbitt, Compliance Officer.

WL 648714
Dear Mr. Redwood:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1920 McGarry St., Vernon, CA 90058-1030 from October 24, 2022, through November 25, 2022. During this inspection the FDA investigators found serious violations of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 120 [21 CFR Part 120] Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems and 21 CFR Part 117 Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventative Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule). At the conclusion of the inspection, FDA issued FDA Form 483, Inspectional Observations, listing the deviations found at your firm. Based upon FDA’s inspectional findings, we determined that your food products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)], in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to heath. Additionally, during the inspection, we conducted label reviews of the following products: The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon 16 oz. and 128 oz., Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz., The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot 16 oz., and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz. Our review found violations of the label regulations for foods, 21 CFR Part 101. The violations cause your products to be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)], 403(h)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)], 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)], 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)], 403(i)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §343(i)(1)], and 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)]. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
We have reviewed your response received on December 20, 2022. In your response you stated you have hired a consultant, had employees re-trained in HACCP, and are working on a validated process for all juice products your firm manufactures and distributes. Your response included an employee HACCP training invoice, a consultant contract and invoice, and an invoice for a validation study. Your response also stated that you have purchased a metal detector and new pH meter and have installed a new cooler monitoring device. We are unable to further evaluate your response since it did not provide any supporting documentation showing implementation of your HACCP plan and sanitation monitoring based upon corrective actions made. No supporting documentation was provided to show what progress had been made with your consultants. We have concerns regarding the following serious violations outlined below.
Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) Systems (21 CFR 120):
1. You did not fully implement the monitoring, verification and recordkeeping procedures listed in your HACCP plan, as required by 21 CFR 120.8(a).
Specifically,
Your Critical Control Point (CCP) procedures titled, ""HACCP Plan for Ready to Drink Refrigerated High Pressure Processed (HPP) Apple and Fruit Juices from Concentrates and Fresh Fruit Products"" with “Date: June 24, 2019”, identifies monitoring, verification, and recordkeeping procedures, which you did not fully implement, as evidenced by the following:
a) “Mixing All Ingredients in Tank(b)(4)” – Your procedures identify that this CCP controls for the Hazard of “Clostridium botulinum spore present in tank”, with “Critical limits of the Preventive Measures” to be “pH of the juice products below(b)(4)”. For your low-acid juices of Watermelon Juice and Carrot Juice, you(b)(4). You did not implement your monitoring, verification and recordkeeping procedures as detailed below:
i. Monitoring – Your “Monitoring” procedures for this CCP state to “Check pH of the batch” by a “pH meter” with the frequency of “(b)(4)”. From 8/8/2022 through 9/28/2022, you did not document monitoring of the pH for(b)(4)juices manufactured during this timeframe, as required by your HACCP plan and 21 CFR 120.12(a)(4)(i).ii. Verification – Your “Verification” procedures for this CCP state to conduct verification for the following:
(b)(4)Verification of the production records for pH of the finished product and corrective action records”. From 8/8/2022 through 9/28/2022, you did not conduct the(b)(4)verification of your production records, as required by your HACCP plan and 21 CFR 120.11(a)(1)(iv)(A).
“Calibration of pH meters and buffer solutions expiration dates –(b)(4)” – You did not document the verification/calibration of the pH meter with buffers for the juice production during this timeframe, as required by your HACCP plan and 21 CFR 120.11.
Additionally, the instruction manual from the manufacturer of pH meter, states that the pH meter “(b)(4)”. The manufacturer’s instruction manual also states to use buffers of(b)(4)and(b)(4)for calibration. Your Verification procedures provide for using buffers of(b)(4)and(b)(4)to calibrate your pH meter.
iii. Recordkeeping – Your CCP procedures state for monitoring and verification to be documented on “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)”. On 11/8/2022, our investigator reviewed the two aforementioned records from 8/8/2022 through 9/28/2022, in which it was revealed that all records were missing monitoring and verification documentation, only the “Date”, “Product” name, and “Product Code/Lot Number” were documented; the “pH buffer(b)(4)check expiration”, “pH(b)(4)buffer checked”, “pH(b)(4)buffer checked”, “pH meter calibrated”, “Finished Product pH(b)(4)”, “Product Brix(b)(4)Per Product chart”, “Product meets Critical Limit”, “Signature/Initial”, “Reviewed by and Date” were all left blank. On 11/10/2022, you provided records of manufacture dates, product names, pH values, and Brix values for juices manufactured from 8/1/2022 to 9/28/2022. The information you provided was written on notebook paper that you stated was taken home by your production employee.
The following samples were collected for two types of blended juices with low-acid ingredients manufactured by your facility; you manufacture other blended juices with low-acid ingredients not collected as FDA samples. Based on your production records, these juices were acidified by your facility and achieved pH values below(b)(4). However, these samples revealed that the pH values listed on your monitoring records were incorrect and you were not achieving pH levels below(b)(4), as evidenced by:
iv. FDA Sample 1189046 collected on 11/8/2022 of your finished product Watermelon Juice Pints, 16 fl. oz., under Lot # “(39)1026-1027 USE BY 12/15/2022”, yielded pH values ranging from(b)(4). Your monitoring record for this lot lists pH values of(b)(4)and(b)(4).v. FDA Sample 1189047 collected on 11/8/2022 of your finished product Watermelon Juice Gallons, 128 fl. oz., under Lot # “(39)1102-1103 USE BY 12/22/2022”, yielded the pH value of(b)(4). Your monitoring record for this lot lists a pH value of(b)(4).vi. FDA Sample 1189048 collected on 11/8/2022 of your finished product Carrot Juice Pints, 16 fl. oz., under Lot # “(10)1107-1110 USE BY 12/29/2022”, yielded pH values ranging from(b)(4). Your monitoring record for this lot lists pH values of(b)(4)and(b)(4).
b) “High Pressure Process at Contracted Wilmington Facility Document Reviewed CCP#9” identifies that this CCP controls for the Hazard of “Bacterial pathogenic growth”, with “Critical limits of the Preventive Measures” to be “(b)(4)reduction done by High Pressure Process of(b)(4)psi minimum for a dwell time of(b)(4)seconds (See Validation study done by private lab)”. You did not implement your monitoring procedures as evidenced by:
i. Monitoring – Your “Monitoring” procedures for this CCP require a visual review of the “HPP treatment report” with the frequency of “(b)(4)”. However, you did not conduct monitoring prior to distribution to your customers for the following two lots of juices you manufactured and that were processed via high pressure processing (HPP):
Watermelon Juice Gallons, 128 fl. oz., under Lot # “(39)1102-1103 USE BY 12/22/2022”. This juice was manufactured on 11/2/2022 and processed via HPP on 11/3/2022. You distributed the finished product juice to your customer on 11/7/2022 without first receiving and reviewing the HPP treatment report from your contacted HPP processor. On 11/8/2022, our investigator requested the HPP report for this lot of juice, which you stated was not available for review yet.
Carrot Juice Pints, 16 fl. oz., under Lot # “(10)1107-1110 USE BY 12/29/2022”. This juice was manufactured on 11/7/2022 and processed via HPP on 11/10/2022. You distributed the finished product juice to your customer on 11/16/2022 without first receiving and reviewing the HPP treatment report from your contacted HPP processor. On 11/17/2022, our investigator requested the HPP report for this lot of juice, which you stated was not available for review yet.
c) “Filtering with mesh and inspection for Metal Detection CCP#(b)(4)” – Your procedures identify that this CCP controls for the “Hazard” of “Metal Fragments”, with “Critical limits of the Preventive Measures” of “Mesh inspection (for damage and holes in the mesh larger than(b)(4)to allow metal fragments into the product”. You did not implement your monitoring, verification and recordkeeping procedures as evidenced by:
i. Monitoring – Your “Monitoring” procedures for this CCP states to conduct a “Mesh Inspection for damage or holes in the mesh” by “Visual Inspection”, with the frequency of “(b)(4)during production days(b)(4)”. You do not conduct and document such monitoring, as required by your HACCP plan and 21 CFR 120.12(a)(4)(i).ii. Verification – Your “Verification” procedures for this CCP states to conduct “(b)(4)verification Mesh Inspection log”. You do not conduct and document monitoring on such record, thus you do you do not conduct(b)(4)verification, as required by your HACCP plan and 21 CFR 120.11(a)(1)(iv)(A).
2. You did not validate your HACCP plan is adequate to control food hazards at least once within 12 months after implementation, as required by 21 CFR 120.11(b).
Specifically,
Your HACCP Plan for “Ready to Drink Refrigerated High Pressure Processed (HPP) Apple and Fruit Juices from Concentrates and Fresh Fruit Products” is used for all of your fruit and vegetable juice products and lists critical limits of(b)(4)psi/(b)(4)seconds as the control to achieve a 5-log reduction.
Your(b)(4)validation for high pressure processing (HPP), titled “HPP Process Validation in Juice Products (Total Plate Count, E. coli and Listeria monocytogenes) Date: 11/14/2016”, covers the following 5 juice products you manufacture: watermelon juice, Garden Green, Cleanse Health, mango juice, and cranberry Juice. This validation did not assess the efficacy of the HPP process throughout the 50-day shelf life of the products to ensure a minimum 5-log reduction in the pertinent microorganism throughout its shelf life when stored under normal and moderate abuse conditions, as required by 21 CFR 120.24(a).
Additionally, this validation study does not include the other single-strength juice products you manufacture, including, but not limited to, apple juice, beet juice, blood orange, carrot juice, coconut juice, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, lime juice, orange juice, pineapple juice, pomegranate juice, and tangerine juice.
3. You must monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, at a minimum, conformance with the current good manufacturing practice requirements in 21 CFR 117, Subpart B (CGMPs), that are both appropriate to your plant and the food being processed, to comply with 21 CFR 120.6(b). However, you failed to monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, at a minimum, conformance with CGMPs in the following areas:
a) On October 26, 2022, you failed to monitor handwashing with sufficient frequency to ensure that hands are washed thoroughly at any time when the hands may have become soiled or contaminated, as required by 21 CFR 117.10(b)(3). This is related to prevention of cross contamination from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3).
i. A production employee was observed washing watermelon fruit (grabbing unwashed watermelon from the bin, dunking it in the bath, and placing it on the cutting table) and cutting off the rinds of the watermelon, for watermelon juice production. The employee did not wash/sanitize hands nor change gloves between these two activities.ii. An employee filling gallon bottles of watermelon juice with the bottle filler machine halted filling the bottles to pick up the top cover of the machine which was in contact with the wet production floor and placed it on the bottle filler machine using the same gloved hands. The interior of this top cover is a food contact surface. This employee returned to filling bottles with watermelon juice using the same gloved hands without washing and sanitizing his hands. This employee used the same gloved hand to grab and load bottles on the filler machine, which involved inserting a gloved finger into the interior contact surface of the bottle and the bottle lids. The bottles and lids were not washed prior to filling.iii. During pre-production operations, an employee was observed using gloved hands to unclog the floor drain. This employee was then observed changing gloves but not washing and sanitizing hands prior to filling the fruit washing tank used for washing watermelon fruit prior to cutting.
b) On October 26, 2022, you failed to monitor all plant equipment used in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food to ensure it was adequately maintained to protect against contamination as required by 21 CFR 117.40(a)(1). This is related to prevention of cross contamination from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3). The hose installed above the fruit washing tank was observed to be leaking and dripping water directly into the fruit washing tank during production when washing watermelons. The hose was also observed to have a buildup of debris. Your employee stated that this hose is also used for the water ingredient in the reconstitution of juice concentrates.
c) On October 26, 2022, you failed to monitor plumbing with sufficient frequency to ensure that it was adequately maintained to provide adequate floor drainage as required by 21 CFR 117.37(b)(4). This is related to prevention of cross contamination from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3). The only floor drain in your production room was observed to be clogged, and standing water was observed under and around the fruit cutting table during production.
d) On October 26, 2022, you failed to monitor for the presence of pests in the food plant with sufficient frequency to ensure that pests are not allowed in any area, as required by 21 CFR § 117.35(C). This is related to the exclusion of pests from the food plant, 21 CFR § 120.6 (a)(8). Multiple fly-like insects were observed in the production room during production.
e) On October 26, 2022, you failed to monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure that cleaning and sanitizing of utensils and equipment was conducted in a manner that protected against contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials, as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). This is related to prevention of cross contamination, 21 CFR 123.6(a)(3).
i) While an employee was observed using a hose to spray the bottling machine, subsequent splashing was observed going onto the table with exposed gallon bottles staged for filling. Subsequently, the same bottles were filled with watermelon juice. The bottles were not washed or rinsed prior to being filled.ii) Your employees used(b)(4)(as measured by our FDA-issued test strips) to pre-rinse the food contact surfaces of your fruit bath tank, fruit grinder/blender, production utensils, and bottle filling machine. They did not conduct a water rinse or allow the(b)(4)to air dry on food contact surfaces prior to use; after the pre-rinse with(b)(4), they immediately proceeded to use the aforementioned equipment to manufacture watermelon juice.
f) On October 24, 2022, you failed to monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure that drip or condensate from fixtures, ducts and pipes does not contaminate food, as required by 21 CFR 117.20(b)(4). This is related to the safety of water that comes into contact with food, 21 CFR 123.6(a)(1). Ice buildup was observed in the freezer on both the ceiling and floor. Drip condensate was observed dripping from the freezer ceiling onto a bucket of fruit punch concentrate with a broken lid.
Misbranding Violations
1. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon Juice 16 oz. and 128 oz. and The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot Juice 16 oz. products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that they are false and misleading because the vignette depicts many fruits and vegetables, most of which are not ingredients in or present as flavors in these products. For example, the product labels use a graphic that depicts lemon, lime, orange, kiwi, tomato, artichoke, pineapple, mango, banana, green onions, grapes and possibly star fruit but the only watermelon or carrot juice is used in their production.
2. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon Juice 16 oz. and 128 oz. and The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot Juice 16 oz. are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(h)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(h)(3)] in that they purport to be pasteurized products because the labels bear the statement “pasteurized for your safety.” However, these foods have not been subjected to a safe process or treatment that is prescribed as pasteurization for such food in a regulation nor have you submitted a notification to the Secretary, including effectiveness data regarding the process or treatment as required by that section. Specifically, these juices are not pasteurized, but are instead subject to high pressure processing (HPP).
3. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon 16 oz, and 128 oz, The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot 16 oz, Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz, and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the products are fabricated from two or more ingredients and each ingredient is not declared on the label by its common or usual name and they purport to be beverages containing vegetable or fruit juice but fail to bear a percentage, as required by 21 CFR 101.4 and 101.30 (respectively). For example:
a) The ingredient statement for your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon 16 oz, and 128 oz. and Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz. fail to declare the ingredient citric acid.
b) The Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz, and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz labels do not bear any ingredient declarations.
c) The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot Juice 16 oz, label does not declare concentrated carrot juice by its common or usual name. “Carrot (Con.)” is the not the common or usual name for this ingredient. 21 CFR 101.4(a)(1).
d) All of the products purport to be beverages containing fruit juice and/or vegetable juice, but the labels fail to bear a percentage (the total percentage of such fruit or vegetable juice contained in the food consistent with the language in section 403(i)(2) of the Act) declared by the words ""Contains_ percent (or %)_ juice"" or a similar phrase with the first blank filled in with the percentage of the juice and the second blank (if used) filled in with the name of the particular fruit or vegetable (e.g., ""Contains 50 percent apple juice"" or ""50 percent juice"") juice, as required by 21 CFR 101.30(b)(1).
4. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon 16 oz, and 128 oz., The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot 16 oz, Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz., and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz. products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] in that the nutrition facts information is not provided in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9. Specifically,
a) For your Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz. and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz. products:
The serving size is incorrect. The Reference Amount Customarily Consumed (RACC) for juices and fruit drinks is 240 mL [21 CFR 101.12(b), Table 2]. The net quantity of contents is declared as 16 oz. Sixteen fluid ounces is equivalent to 476 mL. Therefore, the products meet the definition of a single serving container under 21 CFR 101.9(b)(6) because the products are packaged and sold individually and contains less than 200 percent of the RACC. Therefore, the serving size would be the entire container. As such, all of the nutrient information is incorrect.
The dietary fiber and total sugars amounts are not declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(6) on the Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz. label because these are declared as 0 despite a Total Carbohydrate declaration of 22 g.
The saturated fat amount and percent daily value for saturated fat are not declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(2)(i) and 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7) respectively on the Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz. label because it is declared as .36 g with a daily value of 2%. According to the regulations, if the serving contains less than 0.5 gram, the content must be expressed as 0. Furthermore, the percent daily value would also be 0.
In accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iii) the quantitative amounts of potassium, calcium and iron must use the units of measurement and the levels of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv).
5. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot Juice 16 oz., Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz., and Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §343(i)(1)] in that the product labels fail to bear the common or usual name of the food. For example:
a) The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot Juice 16 oz. and the Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz. label fails to bear a name that includes a term indicating the fact that the juices are from concentrate, such as ""from concentrate,"" or ""reconstituted"" in accordance with 21 CFR 102.33(g)(1).
b) The Simply Wholesome products are labeled as either Carrot or Watermelon. These statements of identity do not meet the requirements of 21 CFR 101.3(b) because they are not appropriately descriptive of products that appear to be beverages or juices.
6. Your The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Watermelon 16 oz, and 128 oz. and The Juice Connection Liquid Gold Carrot 16 oz products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] in that the product labels fail to include the place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, as required by 21 CFR 101.5(d). Specifically, the products list the name of the firm and the telephone contact information but fails to include the street address, city, State, and ZIP code; however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory.
Label Comments
The labels fail to provide the net quantity of contents statement in terms of fluid measure which is required if the food is liquid [21 CFR 101.7(a)]. Instead, the labels provide this declaration in terms of weight (oz.). In the case of liquid measure, declaration of the net quantity of contents is to be in the largest whole units (quarts, quarts and pints, or pints, as appropriate) with any remainder in terms of fluid ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pint or quart as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(1).
If ascorbic acid or citric acid are used as preservatives, they must be declared in the ingredient list stating both the common or usual name of the ingredient(s) and a separate description of its function, e.g., ""preservative"", ""to retard spoilage"", ""a mold inhibitor"", ""to help protect flavor"" or ""to promote color retention” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).
The name and address of the responsible firm is not declared on the information panel on the Simply Wholesome Carrot 16 oz and the Simply Wholesome Watermelon 16 oz labels (21 CFR 101.2(b)). If there is insufficient space on the information panel for all required information, the Nutrition Facts label can move to any alternate panel [21 CFR 101.9(j)(13)(ii)(C) & (j)(17)],
In regard to the level of significance for the declaration of potassium, calcium, and iron, please see the additional explanation in “Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels: Questions and Answers Related to the Compliance Date, Added Sugars, and Declaration of Quantitative Amounts of Vitamins and Minerals: Guidance for Industry” found at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/guidance-industry-nutrition-and-supplement-facts-labels-questions-and-answers-related-compliance.
HACCP Comment
Our inspection found that you have one HACCP plan for all the juice products you process titled “HACCP Plan for Ready to Drink Refrigerated High Pressure Processed (HPP) Apple and Fruit Juices from Concentrates and Fresh Fruit Products"" with “Date: June 24, 2019”. However, the HACCP plan does not list and is not specific to each type of juice you process, as required. Please be advised that the plan may only group types of juice products together, or group types of production methods together, if the food hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and procedures required to be identified and performed are essentially identical, provided that any required features of the plan that are unique to a specific product or method are clearly delineated in the plan and are observed in practice.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

WARNING LETTER
April 27, 2023298 E. Monterey Ave.Pomona, CA 91767 USA
RE: 652780
Dear Ibrahim El Shahawy:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.voltcandy.com, between December 2022 and March 2023, where you took orders for “PrimeZEN Black 6000.”1In addition, we observed that your websites www.voltcandyonline.com and https://premierzen.com/, redirect to your website at www.voltcandy.com where you took orders for “PrimeZEN Black 6000.” We also reviewed your social media page at www.facebook.com/voltcandy1/ where you direct consumers to your website, www.voltcandy.com. Further, FDA has obtained a sample and labeling of your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your product contains undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients. Specifically, a sample of your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product contains tadalafil and sildenafil. Tadalafil are sildenafil are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors and the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Cialis and Viagra, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates.
Information on the label and labeling of your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product demonstrates that it is marketed as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003, and approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that tadalafil and sildenafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as food before Cialis and Viagra were approved, your “PrimeZen Black 6000” product is excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your website and social media page that establish the intended use of your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product as a drug include, but are not limited to, the following:
From your product container/package label and product webpage for your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product located at https://voltcandy.com/product/primezen-black-6000mg-male-sexual-performance-enhancement/:
“Increases Time of INTERCOURSE”
“Increases SIZE and ROCK HARD Grow Length, Width of Yours”
“Increases STAMINA and SEX DRIVE”
“FREE from PREMATURE EJACULATION”
“100% Natural, Safe and Effective! Boost your Stamina & Endurance.”
“Stimulates libido and supports normal hormone levels and the quality of sperm as well.”
From a July 17, 2022, post on your social media page, www.facebook.com/voltcandy1/:
“Increases Time of INTERCOURSE”
“Increases SIZE and ROCK HARD Grow Length, Width of Yours”
“Increases STAMINA and SEX DRIVE”
Your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for “PrimeZEN Black 6000.” Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product, which contains undeclared tadalafil and sildenafil, is also a prescription drug as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), in light of its toxicity or potential for harmful effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for its use. Prescription drugs can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs, including for your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product. Your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling bears adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA approved application in effect for this product. For these reasons, your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
Additionally, your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product does not declare that the product contains PDE-5 inhibitors. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the product’s labeling renders your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your product also cause this product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because its labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for serious health risks associated with this product, particularly since anyone who takes your “PrimeZEN Black 6000” product would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of past or present violations that may exist in connection with the products you distribute. In addition to the violations discussed above, FDA observed that your website https://voltcandy.com/ offers for sale products that resemble products in previous FDA warnings about undeclared drug ingredients.2We also note that FDA previously issued a public warning to consumers not to use your “PremierZEN Gold 7000” product after FDA analysis confirmed the presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors.3You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction. Please submit a written response to this letter within fifteen working days from the date of receipt, explaining the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that the product you distribute is not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration within fifteen working days from the date of receipt of this letter.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

See FDA warns consumers to avoid Rhino male enhancement products found at retailers because of undeclared and potentially dangerous drug ingredients. Also, see warnings for similarly labeled “Rhino” and “Imperial” products, by searching “Rhino” and “Imperial” in FDA’s Health Fraud Database.

March 8, 2023Dear Mr. McCauley:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your dietary supplement manufacturing facility, located at 16280 National Parkway, Lansing MI, from June 29 through July 25, 2022. We also reviewed your websites at www.watershed.net and www.shop.watershed.net in December 2022, and your YouTube channel. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your websites, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.

It is derived from Yew trees – Taxus Brevafolia – and bushes and used to kill dividing cells, especially tumor cells.”􀂃 “The taxanes are mitotic inhibitors, meaning that they inhibit tumors primarily by preventing cells from entering mitosis, a process of cell division.

Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Gingko Magic, Milk Thistle Liver Support, Stone Breaker Capsules and Powder, and Magtein products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Gingko Magic, Milk Thistle Liver Support, Stone Breaker Capsules and Powder, and Magtein products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR 111). Based on these violations, your Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, and Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they were prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The violations include the following:
1. You failed to establish specifications required under 21 CFR 111.70. Specifically:a. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, Chanca Piedra is an ingredient in your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, but you did not establish such component specifications for Chanca Piedra. Likewise, Yuan Zhi is an ingredient in your Raw Food World Sleep Deep powder, but you did not establish such component specifications for Yuan Zhi.b. You failed to establish specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or lead to the adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). For example, you did not establish any finished product specifications for Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder, and Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer.
Once you have established specifications required under 21 CFR 111.70, you must determine whether the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
We have reviewed your responses, dated August 12 and August 23, 2022, in which you state you will establish specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of each of the ingredients used in your supplements, and that you will develop procedures to demonstrate that the products you manufacture meet your specifications. We also reviewed your January 22, 2023, response in which you state you have overhauled and improved your document protocols. However, you did not provide any supporting documentation, such as copies of your specifications. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide documentation to support that you have established component and finished product specifications.
2. You must prepare and follow a master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a), and the MMR must include the information required under 21 CFR 111.210. The MMRs used in the manufacture of your Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder, and Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, failed to include the following information, as required by 21 CFR 111.210:a. The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label [21 CFR 111.210(d)].b. A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)].c. A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)].d. Written instructions, including specifications for each step, point or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)].e. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)].f. Written instructions, including specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)].g. Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met [21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)].
In addition, the MMRs for Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer and Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder also do not include the strength, concentration, weight, or measure of each dietary ingredient for each batch size [21 CFR 111.210(a)] and an accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)], nor does the MMR for Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer include a complete list of components to be used [21 CFR 111.210(b)].
We have reviewed your responses dated August 12, 2022, and August 23, 2022, in which you state you will develop written instructions and include them with your MMRs to reflect your procedures in greater detail, including quality control points, manufacturing stages, reserve collection and storage. You also state that you will implement in writing detailed manufacturing procedures, including which utensils are used, and how they should be cleaned and properly stored. We also reviewed your January 22, 2023, response in which you state you have overhauled and improved your document protocols. However, you did not provide any supporting documentation, such as copies of revised MMRs for your products. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide documentation to support that you revised your MMRs and that they are compliant with 21 CFR 111.210.
3. You must prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a), and the BPR must include the information required under 21 CFR 111.260. The BPRs you provided for your Raw Food World Sleep Deep (Lots 8070, 8079), Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer (Lots 7036, 7087), and Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA (Lots 8067, 8044) dietary supplements lacked the following information that must be included in a BPR, as required by 21 CFR 111.260:
a. The identity of equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch [21 CFR 111.260(b)].b. The date and time of maintenance, cleaning and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records where this information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)].c. The unique identifier that you assigned to each component, packaging, and label used [21 CFR 111.260(d)].d. The identity and weight or measure of each component used [21 CFR 111.260(e)].e. A statement of the actual yield or statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing [21 CFR 111.260(f)].f. The actual results obtained during any monitoring operations [21 CFR 111.260(g)].g. The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)].h. Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e) and (g) [21 CFR 111.260(i)].i. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the information required under 21 CFR 111.260(j) [21 CFR 111.260(j)].j. Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including the information required under 21 CFR 111.260(k) [21 CFR 111.260(k)].k. Documentation at the time of performance, that quality control personnel reviewed the batch production record, and approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution [21 CFR 111.260(l)(3)].l. Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)].
We have reviewed your responses, dated August 12 and August 23, 2022, in which you state you will keep detailed cleaning and sanitation records for each production run of any supplement you are manufacturing, that cleaning procedures in sanitation records will become part of all your SOPs, and that each batch record will reflect what cleaning and sanitation was done before and after the batch was manufactured. We also reviewed your January 22, 2023, response in which you state you have overhauled and improved your document protocols. However, you did not provide any supporting documentation, such as copies of BPRs for your products. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide documentation to support that you have revised your BPRs and that they are compliant with 21 CFR 111.260.
4. You failed to maintain your physical plant in a clean and sanitary condition, as required by 21 CFR 111.15(b)(1). Specifically:
a. In your repacking room, there was green residue built up on a ceiling vent for the A/C unit, on the protective grating on a ceiling vent, and on various ceiling tiles. Further, your “Weekly Cleaning Procedure” includes wiping down walls and vents but does not include instructions for cleaning the ceiling tiles.b. In your new packing room, there were several multicolored stains on the walls of the room that were in direct contact with the table used for manufacturing powdered and capsuled dietary supplements. There was dark brown residue built up on a ceiling vent for the A/C unit. You stated during the inspection that this room is used to repack and manufacture dietary supplements such as Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer and to repack food products such as your Empress Blend mix, which contains raw pistachios. You provided two cleaning procedures for this room during the inspection, neither of which contains instructions for preventing allergen cross-contact, nor were you able to provide evidence of implementation of either of these procedures.c. In the warehouse our investigator observed a lawn mower, a snow blower, three orange gas containers, four bags of weed killer (one of which was opened), two canisters of pest control spray, two containers of engine/motor oil, and assorted lawn and gardening equipment that were directly touching or immediately surrounding a number of your products.
We have reviewed your responses and acknowledge that in your August 23, 2022, response you indicated that the green and brown residues are caused when you do not change filters often enough, and that you will change the filters in the rooftop/heating and cooling unit.
In addition, you stated that you cleaned the wall that had the stain on it. You also stated that all gasoline, oil, and other petroleum products have been removed from the building entirely and that you have hired a contractor to maintain the outside of the facility. However, you did not provide evidence of corrective actions, such as photographs of replaced filters, cleaned ceiling tiles and vents, and the warehouse. Further, your response did not indicate that you would update your cleaning and/or maintenance procedures to include cleaning ceiling tiles and a filter replacement schedule, nor did you provide a copy of updated cleaning and/or maintenance procedures. Therefore, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action.
5. Your quality control personnel did not approve or reject written procedures that may affect the identity, purity, strength, or composition of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.105(a). Specifically, during the inspection, we reviewed your “Production Quality Control SOP,” “Incoming Quality Control (IQC) SOP,” “Finished Batches Meeting Product Specifications SOP,” and none of these procedures included a signature from your quality control personnel. Likewise, your quality control personnel did not approve all MMRs, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(1). Specifically during the inspection, we reviewed the MMRs for Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA (50g), Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder (2 oz.), and Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer (60 capsules), and none of these MMRs included a signature from your quality control personnel.
We have reviewed your responses dated August 12, 2022, and August 23, 2022, in which you state you will implement a more detailed quality control protocol and that you are working with a consultant to make the necessary corrections in your current system. We also reviewed your January 22, 2023, response in which you state you have overhauled and improved your document protocols. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action, because you did not provide documentation to support that your quality control unit is reviewing and approving your written procedures and master manufacturing records.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Yew VeggieCaps, and Parasite Killer products were not unapproved new drugs, the products would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, your Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products also do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] in that the labels fail to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
2. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because they do not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement,” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
3. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product labels fail to declare all common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically:
a. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps and Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer products are manufactured into capsules, but the label fails to declare the ingredients that form the capsule itself.b. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps product label fails to declare the standardized common name of Pacific Yew for the declared dietary ingredientTaxus brevifolia(“Yew powder”), as listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce.c. The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder product label fails to declare the standardized common name of polygala for the declared dietary ingredientYuan zhi. Additionally, the product label fails to declare the standardized common name of oriental arborvitae for the declared dietary ingredient bai zi ren (Platycladus orientalis).d. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA product label fails to declare the common or usual name for alpha-GPC, fruit punch flavor, and P5P.e. The Dr. Bob’s Parasite Killer fails to declare the standardized common name for the ingredients “Mimosa Pudica” and “Chandra Piedra” as listed in Herbs of Commerce. Mimosa Pudica is not a standardized common name, but an other common name. In addition, we note that your website indicates that “Chandra Piedra’ is an unidentified species ofPhyllanthus.
4. The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the product label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
5. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the products are derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). Specifically:
a. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic product label fails to include the part of the plant from which the Ginkgo biloba extract is derived.b. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps product label fails to include the part of the plant from which the Yew powder is derived.c. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer product label fails to include the part of the plant from which its botanical ingredients are derived, including clove powder, wormwood, guarana, bearberry, epazote, and “mimosa pudica.”d. The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder product label fails to declare in English the part of the plant from which the bai zi ren and yuan zhi are derived.
6. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, and Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Specifically:
a. The dosage amount listed on Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic product label suggest the consumer take a “maintenance dosage” of 2-4 capsules daily or a “health challenge” dosage of 5-8 capsules daily, but the serving size listed is 2 capsules.b. The dosage amount listed on Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps product label suggests the consumer take a “maintenance dosage” of 2 capsules daily or a “health challenge” dosage of 5-8 capsules daily, but the serving size listed is 2 capsules.c. The dosage amount listed on Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer product label indicates two to four capsules on an empty stomach. Furthermore, the serving size of 750 mg in the Supplement Facts label does not correlate with the dosage declaration.
7. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(q)(5)(F) and 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343(q)(1)(A) and (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36.Specifically:
a. Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic:i. The product label lists its dietary ingredient, ginkgo biloba extract, outside the nutrition label of the supplement facts label. This dietary ingredient should be listed inside the supplement facts label along with its quantitative amount by weight per serving in metric units in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).ii. The product label declares nutrients with quantitative amounts of zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients not present, or in amount that can be declared as zero in 21 CFR 101.9(c), shall not be declared, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2).
b. Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCapsi. The product label lists its dietary ingredient, “yew powder”, outside the nutrition label of the supplement facts label.

The product label declares dietary ingredients with quantitative amounts of zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 21 CFR 101.9(c), shall not be declared, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2).iii. The serving size for the product must be expressed in common household measures as set forth in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and must be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams).iv. The title, “Supplement Facts,” is not in bolded font nor set at full width of the nutrition label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).
d. Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer product label lists dietary ingredients, including papaya seed, golden seal leaf, clove powder, wormwood, guarana, bearberry, epazote, pumpkin seed, grapefruit seed, “mimosa pudica,” cayenne pepper, and black walnut hull, outside the nutrition label of the supplement facts label.

f. Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps, and Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA products Supplement Facts labels each declare a statement referencing a 2,000 calorie diet. This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D). Furthermore, for the Dr. Bob’s Naturals Yew VeggieCaps there is no provision for the statement “Not a significant source of vitamin D, calcium, iron, and …” in the Supplement Facts label.
8. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.7. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.7(b)(1), statements of weight shall be in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce. The net quantity of contents statement, expressed in terms of weight, must specify both metric (i.e., grams or kilograms) and U.S. Customary System (i.e., ounces or pounds), to comply with 21 CFR 101.7 and 15 U.S.C. 1453(a)(2) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.
9. The Dr. Bob’s Naturals Parasite Killer product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product label lists black walnut in the ingredients statement while the “Contains” statement declares that no tree nut is present in the product, which is not in accordance with section 403(w) of the Act.
Section 201(qq) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(qq), defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients [section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen) [section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
10. Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals Ginkgo Magic, Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA, and The Raw Food World Sleep Deep Powder are each misbranded withing the meaning of section 403(r)(6) [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] in that the products make structure function claims but fail to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
We also have the following comments:
1. You may confirm the identity of other components (that are not dietary ingredients) by relying on a certificate of analysis from the supplier of the component that you receive provided that you:• First establish component specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b).• Meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii).
Your Dr. Bob’s Naturals NootriTonic ULTRA product label declares “stevia’ in the Ingredient list. If you are using highly purified steviol glycosides obtained from stevia leaves in your product, please note that “stevia” refers to the botanical and is not the common or usual name of these highly purified ingredients. Rather, the common or usual name for highly purified steviol glycosides depends on the ingredient composition. If the sweetener is purified to contain 95 percent or more of a single steviol glycoside, the specific name of that single steviol glycoside is the common or usual name. For example, the name “rebaudioside A” should be used for ingredients with 95% or more rebaudioside A; the name “stevioside” should be used for ingredients with 95% or more stevioside. If the sweetener is purified to contain 95 percent or more of a mixture of two or more steviol glycosides, the name “steviol glycosides” would be the common or usual name.

RE: 633509
Dear Mr. Greenspan:
This letter concerns your products Uplift Max and Shred Her Max, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website athttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-andcosmetic-act-fdc-actand the FDA regulations athttps://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The labels of your products Uplift Max and Shred Her Max list hordenine HCl as a dietary ingredient; however, hordenine HCl is not a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. Hordenine HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because it is not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the hordenine HCl used in your Shred Her Max and Uplift Max products, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
Hordenine HCl is not generally recognized as safe under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because hordenine HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Shred Her Max and Uplift Max products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also bring to your attention a misrepresentation on your website, www.nlaforher.com. Your Terms and Conditions webpage (https://nlaforher.com/pages/terms-and-conditions) states that your website is the property of Optimum Nutrition, Inc. (Optimum Nutrition). Further, on this same webpage, you refer consumers to Optimum Nutrition’s Terms and Conditions page (https://www.optimumnutrition.com/enus/terms-and-conditions-use#xudXJ5iUVOY8YVKL.99) for more information, further implying that your website and company are affiliated with Optimum Nutrition. However, Optimum Nutrition has notified us that they do not own or operate your website and have no business relationship with your firm.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to Dr. Aaron Dotson, Compliance Officer, via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
April 4, 2023
RE: CMS CASE # 646308
Dear Dr. Robert L Bynum:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your product label for Dodecin following an inspection of your facility at 1906 Potomac Dr., Columbia, MO 65203 between August 10, 2022 and August 17, 2022. In addition, FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.bypronutrition.com in October and November 2022, and March 2023 and has determined that you take orders there for the product Dodecin. The claims on your product label and website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
Examples of some of the claims on your product label and website that provide evidence that your Dodecin product is intended for use as a drug include:
On the product label:
“DODECIN: The ingredients in Dodecin are formulated to address multiple pain and inflammation pathways.”
On your website www.bypronutrition.com:
On your Order Now page, for the single product Dodecin:
“Dodecin - Pain and Inflammation Relief”
“When you're in pain, there's only one thing you care about - RELIEF. Thousands of people have experienced the life-changing benefits of Dodecin™.”
“Dodecin™ is a nutraceutical supplement developed by a physician who, like you, is a chronic pain sufferer.”
“Dodecin™ is made of 12 key ingredients - each chosen for its specific ability to address the complex causes of pain.”
On your Dodecin’s Ingredients page:
“Curcumin inhibits inflammation in and around your joints, muscles, and other tissues, thus decreasing associated aches and pains.”
“MSM . . . [R]eleiving [sic] many of the symptoms associated with arthritis, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.”
“ALA is a reputable therapy for preventing nerve pain. It also detoxifies your body; fighting…toxic metals, such as Mercury.”
“Medical research studies show that Silymarin, found in Milk-Thistle, decreases inflammation of tissue and relieves associated pain.”
“Trypsin…Combined with bromelain, it helps treat conditions such as osteoarthritis.”
“CMO also regulates inflammation -reducing pain.”
“Bromelain is a powerful anti-inflammitory nutrient. In recent years, numerous clinical studies have shown that bromelain is potentially more effective than many prescription drugs in relieving pain caused by inflammation.”
“Boswellia Seratta is used clinically to treat degenerative & inflammatory joint disorders. It reduces the white blood cell count in joint fluid, and inhibts leukocyte elastase, which is released in rheumatoid arthritis.”
“Glucosamine combined with MSM can also be effective against osteoarthritis, and the pain caused by inflamed joints.”
On your Dodecin Benefits page:
“Dodecin’s benefits include:…Back and joint chronic pain relief…Reduction in Nerve (neuropathy) Pain”
“Dodecin can also Provide:…Reduction in chronic Inflammatory Skin Conditions…Reduction in Fibromyalgia & other chronic pain syndromes”
“Chronic inflammation and pain need to have a loading dose to suppress the over load occurring in your body. Just like steroid dosing for acute inflammation your doctor typically will give a short burst to quickly suppress the inflammation.”
On your Dodecin FAQs page:
“What is Dodecin?”… “Dodecin™ is a physician formulated nutraceutical (dietary supplement) designed to address pain and inflammation pathways.”
“What are the ingredients in Dodecin?”… “Dodecin™ is formulated from 12 ingredients that support the anti-inflammatory biochemical pathways:”
“Does DodecinTM work for everybody?”… “Dodecin™, typical onset of pain control is 3 to 7 days.”
“How quickly should I expect to notice results?”… “until you find the amount needed for inflammation or pain control.”
On the Youtube video attached to your homepage, you make the following statements in the video:
“[F]ormulated for the management of chronic pain syndromes”
“Dodecin has 12 different ingredients to address different pathways of pain”
“[T]his is something that you can do that actually addresses the inflammation in pain”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Dodecin for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
On your Testimonials page:
“My pharmacist recommended this product to me after I complained about pain all the time all over from osteoarthritis. She said try this it is all natural and we have been having people report fantastic results! So I bought a bottle of Dodecin and started taking according to directions. Wow within two days I was notice I got a difference in pain throughout my body.”
""My wife is going through chemo and her arthritis has been nearly killing her. Dodecin worked for her -then I tried it and we both love it. It worked within a matter of days!""
“I prefer Dodecin over chronic use of Rx or OTC NSAIDS for arthritis due to the potential renal and gastric side effects of chronic NSAID use.”
“I soon grew tired of fighting the common cold and decided the joint pain and swelling from the Lupus would be more tolerable. Then I discovered Dodecin. After taking Dodecin for two days I started feeling much better. I have been taking Dodecin for 8 months and it has kept my Lupus symptoms in check. I no longer use any other medication to treat my Lupus except for Dodecin.”
Your Dodecin product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Dodecin product is intended for treatment or prevention of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, treatment, or prevention without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Dodecin product fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your product is not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Andrew A. Hoopes, Compliance Officer, 8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205, Lenexa, KS 66214.

November 22, 2022
Dear Dr. Pai:This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted a joint inspection of your dietary supplement and drug manufacturing facility, located at 37 & 41 Veronica Avenue, Somerset, NJ 08873-6800 on November 29 through 30, 2021; December 1 through 3, 6 through 9, 13 through 14, 17, 2021; and February 1 and 3, 2022. Based on our inspection and our. review of labeling collected during the inspection, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You may find the Act and the FDA's regulations through links on FDA's home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
We received e-mail correspondences from you dated March 14, 2022, April 11, 2022, May 11, 2022, July 11, 2022, and August 11 , 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, lnspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Dietary Supplement cGMP Violations
During the inspection, our investigators found significant violations of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111), Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements. These violations cause the dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet cGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of the cGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to ensure that the tests or examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically:
a. Your finished product testing uses ""(b)(4)"" as a method to verify if finished product specifications for strength have been met for your(b)(4)Softgels - lot(b)(4),(b)(4)Mini Softgels - lot(b)(4),(b)(4)Softgels - lot(b)(4),(b)(4)Softgels - lot(b)(4), and(b)(4)Formula Softgels - lot(b)(4). Finished product testing using ""(b)(4)"" is not an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify finished product specifications.
i. For your(b)(4)Softgels product: You use ""(b)(4)"" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for ingredients including, but not limited to,(b)(4).ii. For your(b)(4)Mini Softgels product: You use ""(b)(4)"" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for each of the ingredients in the product. In addition, during the inspection, you stated that no testing for the strength of any ingredient has been conducted for this product.iii. For your(b)(4)Softgels product: You use ""(b)(4)"" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients(b)(4)extract and(b)(4)extract. Your specifications for this product, dated May 20, 2021, removed a test for the strength of(b)(4), a maker in the(b)(4)extract. The previous version of your specifications, dated November 6, 2020, included a test for(b)(4)to determine the amount of(b)(4)using your method, ""MSIH-201 ,"" instead of ""(b)(4)."" During the inspection, you indicated the change to ""(b)(4)"" was at the request of the customer, as documented in your change control document dated May 18, 2021. You could not provide a basis for why removing this test and replacing it with ""(b)(4)"" would ensure the product met finished product specifications.iv. For your(b)(4)Softgels product: You use ""(b)(4)"" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients(b)(4).v. For your(b)(4)Formula Softgel product: You use ""(b)(4)"" as a method to determine whether specifications are met for the ingredients(b)(4)(standardized to(b)(4)),(b)(4)Extract,(b)(4)Paste,(b)(4)Extract,(b)(4)Oil,(b)(4)(from(b)(4)),(b)(4)Extract,(b)(4),(b)(4)Extract (standardized to(b)(4)), and(b)(4)Extract (standardized to(b)(4)).
b. You use FTIR for identity testing for some of the ingredients in your dietary supplement products. Your procedure, RMA-279, ""Testing Procedure for Identification by IR in Raw Material"" requires comparison of the sample spectrum to a ""Reference Standard/Reference Sample or Monograph Spectrum."" During the inspection, you informed our investigators that your firm uses a purchased reference standard if there is one commercially available. For many of the ingredients, you use a reference sample because there is no reference standard available. A reference sample is a previous lot of the material from the vendor or a sample provided from the vendor to be used as reference material. However, your laboratory does not require verification of the previous lot or that the provided material is appropriate for use as a standard. Identity testing using FTIR to compare the sample spectrum to an unverified reference sample is not an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify that specifications are met. For example:
i.(b)(4): You used FTIR for identity testing of(b)(4)lot(b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard. In addition,(b)(4)is received as a pre-blend of(b)(4)different ingredients. During the inspection, you stated that FTIR cannot determine if each of the ingredients is present in the product. Identity testing must be able to confirm the identity of each ingredient in the finished product.(b)(4)lot(b)(4)was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement(b)(4)Softgel lot(b)(4).ii.(b)(4)Extract: You used FTIR for identity testing of(b)(4)Extract lot(b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard.(b)(4)lot(b)(4)was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement(b)(4)Softgel lot(b)(4).iii.(b)(4)Extract: You used FTIR for identity testing of(b)(4)Extract lot(b)(4). During the inspection, you stated this was a previously received lot and there was no work done to qualify the previously received lot as a reference standard.(b)(4)Extract lot(b)(4)was ultimately used in the manufacturing of the finished dietary supplement(b)(4)lot(b)(4).
c. You use the(b)(4)Test Method to test your dietary supplement products for compliance with microbial specifications. This system includes testing for:
Total aerobic plate count, procedure MICROSTP-001
Yeast and mold, procedure MICROSTP-002
Salmonella, procedure MICROSTP-003
Staphylococcus aureus, procedure MICROSTP-004
Escherichia coli, procedure MICROSTP-005
Enterobacteriaceae, procedure MICROSTP-006
However, you are not conducting suitability testing to demonstrate whether these methods are appropriate for testing all of your products. According to your(b)(4)Technical Report, dated April 8, 2019, you conducted suitability testing for ten products, but not for all products. The report also determined that two of the ten products,(b)(4), required modified preparation steps for neutralization, or else the test may not provide a valid result.
The ingredients and amount of ingredients unique to individual dietary supplement products may interfere with the ability of microbial tests to provide a reliable result. Without suitability testing to demonstrate that a product does not interfere with the test, the method may not be determined to be an appropriate, scientifically valid method to verify that specifications are met.
Your response dated April 11, 2022 states you will provide new documents and procedures, including Finished Product Dossiers for all the products identified during the inspection and Finished Product Specification and Report Forms. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because your submission did not include documentation that shows that you are implementing such corrections. For example, you provided only draft examples of your Finished Product Dossiers and Finished Product Specification and Report Forms for some of your dietary supplement products.
In addition, your response suggested exempting ingredients that do not have verification methods from finished product testing, however, you did not provide the required documentation for such exemptions. Note that, to exempt one or more product specifications from verification requirements under 21 CFR 111.75(d), you must document why any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, and any other information, will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch, and your quality control personnel must review and approve the documentation that you provide.
2. Your firm's quality control personnel failed to conduct a material review and make a disposition decision when the established specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(a)(1).
Specifically, out of specification results were received for the following components and finished products:(b)(4)lot(b)(4),(b)(4)lot(b)(4),(b)(4)lot(b)(4)bulk softgels,(b)(4)raw material lot(b)(4),(b)(4)raw material lot(b)(4), and(b)(4)Suspension raw material lot(b)(4). For these components and finished products, your quality control unit failed to follow your procedure, ""MICRO009: Laboratory Investigation of ""Out of Specification"" Results for Microbiological Testing,"" which outlines the appropriate steps when a microbial specification is not met during testing. Your procedure states, if laboratory testing results fail to meet the specification, ""(b)(4)"" and, ""The(b)(4)(Attachment Ill)."" You did not follow your procedure to conduct and document a laboratory investigation using Attachment Ill of your procedure; rather, you retested the samples until a passing result was obtained, and then reported the passing result without conducting an investigation for the initial failing results. No material review or disposition decision was performed by your firm in these examples where the dietary supplements or components failed to meet established specifications.
Your response dated April 11, 2022 states, ""Investigations and Corrective Actions are completed. All microbiological testing is currently being sent out while improvements to the micro lab facility and procedures can be carried out to address the apparent contamination issues in the micro lab. (Status: Completed on time)."" We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation to support that you have made the proposed corrective actions.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your product(b)(4), is a misbranded dietary supplement within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
Your ""(b)(4)"" product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, the product's label declares serving size as 2. The directions state to take two (2) softgels daily divided between morning and evening, with food, or as recommended by a healthcare practitioner. Serving size should be one based on one softgel per eating occasion.
We also offer the following comments:
1. During the inspection, we observed that your quality control operations did not include reviewing and approving the results of required tests as required by 21 CFR 111.110(c). For example, your laboratory Data Reviewer did not review the electronic audit trail for your analytical testing. According to your response letter, dated April 11, 2022; training was provided to include guidelines for audit trail review and are being followed. You also provided an example of what the training consisted of; however, you did not include the names of the personnel who were retained. FDA will assess this observation during the next inspection in order to determine the effectiveness of the training on personnel.
2. Your(b)(4)Softgels Supplement Facts label declares ""(b)(4)"" but only lists one ingredient, that being(b)(4)fruit. We note a proprietary blend refers to more than one ingredient. (21 CFR 101.36(c)].Human Drugs CGMP Violations
This section summarizes significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501 (a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
We acknowledge receipt of your response, dated March 11, 2022, and subsequent correspondence.
During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
1. Your firm failed to ensure that laboratory records included complete data derived from all tests necessary to ensure compliance with established specifications and standards (21 CFR 211.194(a)).
Your quality control (QC) analysts routinely recorded raw data, such as sample weights, into unofficial notebooks during release testing. Our inspection found an analyst maintained two separate notebooks recording different sample weights for the same assay test. Your analyst admitted to altering the sample weights in the approved notebook so that calculations based on those results would meet your release specifications. At least(b)(4)batches of Aspire Daytime Mucus and Sinus soft gel bulk product failed to meet your firm's internal assay specification for the active ingredients. Your quality unit released these batches based on a review of inaccurate laboratory data.
In your response, you stated that you conducted an investigation, retested the(b)(4)batches that were released based on falsified data, and concluded that all(b)(4)batches met your firm's acceptance criteria after retesting.
Your response is inadequate because your quality unit failed to conduct a comprehensive retrospective investigation to determine the extent of breaches of data integrity found during the inspection. It also lacks a root cause investigation into the original assay results failing to meet your release specification when the actual sample weights documented in the unofficial composition notebook were used for the calculation. You failed to provide scientific justification to invalidate the original unexpected results and only report the favorable results.
In response to this letter, provide a comprehensive, independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system.
2. Your firm failed to establish laboratory controls that include scientifically sound and appropriate specifications, standards, sampling plans, and test procedures designed to assure that components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, labeling, and drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.160(b)).
You failed to establish sufficient specifications and analytical testing procedures for critical quality attributes for the drugs that you manufacture. You lacked specifications and failed to test for the 4-aminophenol impurity in acetaminophen-containing drug products.
For example, at least three acetaminophen-containing solid oral dosage form drug products lacked the specification and testing procedure for 4-aminophenol content.
In your response, you stated that your drug products do not have a specific USP monograph, and therefore there was not a method for testing for impurities. You also committed to developing, validating, and implementing an analytical method to detect and quantify impurities by September 2022.
Your response is inadequate. Regardless of whether a drug product has a USP monograph, you are responsible for ensuring you have scientifically sound specifications and test methods used to determine drug quality and purity prior to release. The 4-aminophenol impurity is a known impurity of acetaminophen and should be controlled and established as a condition of release of acetaminophen-containing drug products. FDA is also concerned that you plan to continue manufacturing and releasing the same drug products without testing for the 4-aminophenol impurity prior to implementing an analytical testing method. for this impurity. You have not implemented interim controls to ensure product quality and to mitigate the risk to patients.
In response to this letter, provide:
A list of chemical and microbial test methods and specifications used to analyze each batch of your drug products before a batch disposition decision, and the associated procedures, including but not limited to 4-aminophenol content for all acetaminophen containing drug products.
An assessment to ensure complete and appropriate specifications are established for batch release and stability studies for all drug products manufactured by your firm.
Your detailed plan for retrospective testing of all drug product batches that were insufficiently tested and remain within expiry. Determine whether each batch conforms to all appropriate specifications, including but not limited to 4-aminophenol impurity content.
A risk assessment on marketed finished drug product batches containing acetaminophen that were not tested for the 4-aminophenol impurity.
Interim controls established prior to completing the development, validation, and implementation of the test method to detect the 4-aminophenol impurity.
3. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).
During this ·inspection, FDA investigators observed that your firm performed multiple single ""trial"" injections of test samples on high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) systems without any scientific justification.
Your response stated that your firm's standard operating procedures (SOPs) for liquid chromatographic analysis and gas chromatographic analysis allow ""trial"" injections of the standard solution only to verify the resolution of HPLC and gas chromatography (GC) systems, and the ""trial"" injections must be a part of the sample set sequence. Your investigation report PE-22-0005 confirmed that ""trial"" injections were performed using test samples instead of standards.
Your response is inadequate. The inspection documented that your HPLC audit trail records showed that these ""trial"" injections were not part of the sample set sequence, which is contrary to the statement in your firm's response to the Form FDA 483 observations. In addition, these standalone sample ""trial"" injections were made before your official reinjections of the content uniformity samples in a sample set sequence, which is contrary to the statement in your retrospective investigation PE-22-0005.
The injection of trial samples is not acceptable, in part, because all data from analysis of product samples must be retained and reviewed (21 CFR 211 .22, 211.165, 211.192, and 211.194). Therefore, FDA considers it a violative practice to perform a trial injection. FDA also considers it a violative practice to use an actual sample in test, preparation, or equilibration runs as a means of disguising testing into compliance.
Reinjecting to obtain favorable results
Your firm lacked adequate documentation of all calculations and rationale for additional laboratory testing when unexpected content uniformity results for acetaminophen in batches(b)(4)were obtained during a process validation study for Aspire Mucus and Pain Relief soft gel drug product. Your analyst noticed differences in the peak shapes, reinjected the samples the next day, and used favorable reinjection results to invalidate the original results. Your response indicated that the laboratory manager was informed of the unexpected test results and authorized the reinjection of the samples. However, neither the inspection nor your firm's response included evidence to support that statement.
In your response, you indicated that a retrospective investigation PE-22-0005 was initiated for the unexpected content uniformity results for batch(b)(4)and(b)(4)in Aspire Mucus and Pain Relief soft gel process validation. Your investigation, initiated four months after the event, concluded that the initial results were invalidated because the analyst forgot to add the check standard.
Your response is inadequate. Your above conclusion is not supported by the chromatography data available. For example, there were two sample sets run on October 11, 2021 : the first set (without the check standard) was aborted in the middle of the run; and the second set (with the check standard) was completed and generated higher peak area counts for the two content uniformity samples. Your firm's conclusion contradicts the analyst's notebook ((b)(4)) comments which attributed the higher results to the different peak shapes compared to the rest of the samples analyzed in the same sample set.
Failure to investigate above limit results for purified water
Our review of your(b)(4)system audit trail report noted multiple results for total microbial testing of your purified water system were above limit. No investigation was performed. You also failed to follow your SOP MICRO009 and SOP QA025 which require an out of specification (OOS) investigation to be initiated when obtaining out of limit microbial test and purified water results, respectively. Purified water is used as one of the components in your OTC drug products.
In your response, you stated that your in-house testing was for information only and you sent the purified water samples to an outside testing laboratory for microbial release testing during the period of January 21, 2021, to July 9, 2021. You also stated that you suspended all internal microbiological laboratory operations until personnel and resources are in place to ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements.
Your response is inadequate:
Samples to your external laboratory were sent only after you obtained the in-house out of limit results.
You lack evidence to support that a protocol was in place for the testing of your samples later claimed to be for information only.
You failed to address the in-house test failures from September to November 2021.
Your retrospective investigation was performed in March 2022, approximately one year after the first out of limit result was obtained.
Your firm remains responsible for investigating all out of limit test results in a timely manner.
In response to this letter, provide:
A retrospective, independent review of all invalidated OOS (including in-process and release/stability testing) results for products currently in the U.S. market and within expiry as of the date of this letter and a report summarizing the findings of the analysis, including the following for each OOS:
o Determine whether the scientific justification and evidence relating to the invalidated OOS result conclusively or inconclusively demonstrates causative laboratory error.o For investigations that conclusively establish laboratory root cause, provide rationale and ensure that all other laboratory methods vulnerable to the same or similar root cause are identified for remediation.o For all OOS results found by the retrospective review to have an inconclusive or no root cause identified in the laboratory, include a thorough review of production (e.g., batch manufacturing records, adequacy of the manufacturing steps, suitability of equipment/facilities, variability of raw materials, process capability, deviation history, - complaint history, batch failure history). Provide a summary of potential manufacturing root causes for each investigation, and any manufacturing operation improvements.
A comprehensive review and remediation plan for your OOS result investigation systems. The CAPA should include but not be limited to addressing the following:
o Quality unit oversight of laboratory investigationso Identification of adverse laboratory control trendso Resolution of causes of laboratory variationo Initiation of thorough investigations of potential manufacturing causes whenever a laboratory cause cannot be conclusively identifiedo Adequately scoping of each investigation and its CAPAo Revised OOS investigation procedures with these and other remediations

RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses https://www.todosmedical.com, https://www.mytollovid.com and https://www.tollovid.myshopify.com on June 23, 2022. We also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/todosmedical and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWsJLl1iB9qlZUSicQ9e-Mg, where you direct consumers to your websites https://www.mytollovid.com and https://www.todosmedical.com, respectively, to purchase your products. Additionally, we reviewed your product listings on your Amazon storefront at https://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&marketplaceID=ATVPDKIKX0DER&me=A1DTBIYVC3OVND. The FDA has observed that your websites and your Amazon storefront offer the product Tollovid 3CL Protease Inhibitor Delayed Release (Tollovid) for sale in the United States and that this product is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. Based on our review, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, this product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your product and misleadingly represent it as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
• “3CL Protease Inhibitors: The Potential Key to Combating the SARS-CoV-2 Virus Life Cycle . . . Studies have shown … that by using protease inhibitors, we can stop the virus’ ability to replicate itself, halting the spread in it [sic] tracks.” [from your website https://todosmedical.com/3cl- protease-inhibitors?hsLang=en]
• Under the heading “Protease Inhibitors”:“Todos has acquired exclusive distribution rights to the immune boosting, dietary supplement Tollovid™ and is developing Tollovir,™ a highly potent 3CL protease inhibitor as a COVID-10 antiviral.” [from your homepage at https://www.todosmedical.com]
• ""What is a 3CL Protease?Formally known as C3 Endopeptidase, the main protease found in coronaviruses."" [from https://mytollovid.com/a/faq]
• ""Todos Medical featured in a new Seeking Alpha article: Pfizer's #3CL #Protease #Inhibitor May Cut the Achilles’ Heel of #COVID19. . .Todos . . .has a promising pipeline of products . . . Its 3CL protease inhibitor is called Tollovir. It is an antiviral, but it is also designed to support immune function. They also have a dietary supplement made of the same active ingredient that supports immune function.” [from a September 8, 2021 post on your social media webpage https://www.facebook.com/todosmedical]
Your website https://www.mytollovid.com also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Tollovid for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease (https://mytollovid.com/pages/testimonials). Examples of such testimonials include:
J. Reese on November 14, 2021“A 5-day dosing regimen of Tollovid, from all the research I have done on 3CL Protease inhibitors, should keep the [infection] from replicating to the point I need hospitalization. A small price to pay for my health.”
Anonymous on September 27, 2021“Excited to boost my immune system and not worry anymore in unmasked situations!! Work in retail and desired extra protection against illness during uncertain times.”
Keegan B. on January 12, 2021“I believe Tollovid helps … When I found out I tested positive, I immediately ordered a bottle of Tollovid. I took 6 capsules a day, and I believe it helped me in the fight against this disease. I am fortunate to have known about this product because I do believe it gave me an advantage to a quick recovery . . .”
Michael B. on December 8, 2020“My family and I were directly exposed a few weeks ago, we had just started taking Tollovid and no one in my family contracted it while the other family we were with all ended up positive and sick. While there is no way of proving it was because of taking Tollovid, I’m grateful we were on it and will continue to take it.‘""
You should take immediate action to address this matter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act. Within 48 hours, please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.govdescribing the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of any violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found athttp://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: CMS Case 640206
Dear Dr. Rochon:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility located at 2810 Hopi Drive, Sedona, Arizona from July 11, 2022, through July 15, 2022. The inspection and our review of your product labeling revealed serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
We received your response on August 4, 2022, which was written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
During the inspection, our investigator collected finished product labels for your products and the Herbal Vitality product catalog in which you offer your products for sale. Based on our review of your product labels and product catalog, we have determined that the claims for your products Acute Kidney Stone Relief, Adult Cold & Flu, Antifungal Formula, Baby Cold & Flu, Children’s Antibiotic Formula, Children’s Asthma Formula, Hemorrhoid Remedial, Pregnancy Cold and Flu Formula, Prostrate Formula, Special Lyme Formula, Fibromyalgia Formula, Hepatitis C Formula Glycerite, Kidney Stone Remedial, Lung Tonic COPD, Children’s Antiviral Formula, Children’s Allergy Relief Formula, Antiparasite Formula, Anti-Amoeba Formula, Hyperthyroid Relief, PCOS Formula, and Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis establish the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Acute Kidney Stone Relief• Product name: The product name implies that the product is intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent kidney stones.• Product catalog: “…antispasmodic analgesic and demulcent, and aid in relief of renal and ureter spasm and inflammation.”

Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis• Product name: The product name implies the product is intended to cure, mitigate, treat or prevent tonsillitis/otitis.1• Product catalog: “Antimicrobial and lymphagogue herbs are combined with alternative, anodynal, and diaphoretic herbs to tonify mucous membranes and immune system, cleanse the tissues and clear heat.”
Your above products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Special Lyme Formula, Hepatitis C Formula Glycerite, Kidney Stone Remedial, Lung Tonic COPD, Acute Kidney Stone Relief, Adult Cold & Flu, Baby Cold & Flu, Children’s Asthma Formula, Pregnancy Cold and Flu Formula, and Fibromyalgia Formula are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your products fail to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, your products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
During the inspection, our investigator found significant violations of FDA’s regulation for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the inspection, we determined that these violations cause the dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, even if your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis product were not an unapproved new drug, it would still be an adulterated dietary supplement within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)].
Your significant violations of the CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish, for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, component specifications on limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Specifically, you have not established limits on contaminants such as microbes, pesticides, and heavy metals that may be present in your components, including the Eleutherococcus senticosus, Astragalus membranaceus, and Ganoderma lucidum used in your Immune Tonic (Lot 052422); and the Calendula officinalis, Echinacea angustifolia, and Filipendula ulmaria used in your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis (Lot 031722).
Note that in addition to establishing specifications, you must ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
We have reviewed your written response, in which you state, “Specifications for limits on contamination will be added to all current and new Master Manufacturing Records for multi-dietary ingredient herbal tincture and glycerite supplements when contamination is a possibility.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any specifications for limits on contamination for review.
2. You failed to establish specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, your firm has not established product specifications for any of your multi-ingredient finished dietary supplement products.
Note that in addition to establishing specifications, you must verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Further, you must ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We have reviewed your written response, in which you state, “We have begun to update or create Master Manufacturing Records for all our multi-dietary ingredient herbal tincture and glycerite supplements, to include specifications for identity, strength, and composition of the finished dietary supplement.” Your response also states, “Specifications for limits on contamination will be added to all current and new Master Manufacturing Records for multi-dietary ingredient herbal tincture and glycerite supplements when contamination is a possibility.” However, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because the updated master manufacturing record for your Children’s Tonsils & Ear Formula, included with your response, does not include finished product specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contaminants; in addition, you have not provided specifications for your other dietary supplement products.
3. You failed to include in your quality control operations in your master manufacturing record, batch production record (BPR), and manufacturing operations that include approving and releasing, or rejecting, each finished batch for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(8). Specifically, your BPRs show that your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis (Lot 031722) and Immune Tonic (Lot 052422) were released for distribution on March 17, 2022, and May 24, 2022, respectively, without being reviewed and approved by your quality control personnel. You further indicated that quality control does not review and approve for release any of your multi-ingredient herbal tincture supplements. We note you have received complaints regarding customers receiving the products that seemed different from what they ordered. Your internal investigations have found that the ordered products were either incorrectly mixed or mislabeled.
We have reviewed your written response, which states, “All multi-dietary ingredient herbal tincture and glycerite supplements will be released for distribution by Quality Control before they are distributed to a customer or warehouse.” In your response, your firm appended a production and release record for your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis product, which is now called Children’s Tonsils and Ears Formula, Lots CTOF080122HV and CTOF080322HV. We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because the production and release records do not specify if any of the individuals signing the records are quality control personnel.
4. You failed to prepare a written master manufacturing record (MMR) that includes written instructions for corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5). Specifically, your Pouring Formulas instruction sheet, which you provided in response to our request for your MMRs for the Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis and Immune Tonic, does not include a corrective action plan for use when a specification is not met.
We have reviewed your response, which included a copy of an updated MMR for your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis product, which is now called Children’s Tonsils and Ears Formula. However, this MMR still does not include the corrective action plan required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5). We also note there is no indication that the updated MMR will be reviewed and approved by your quality control personnel, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(1).
5. Your batch production record (BPR) did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, you indicated during the inspection that the pour sheets for the multi-tincture formulas are your BPRs. The pour sheets for the Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis (Lot 031722) and Immune Tonic (Lot 052422) lacked the following required information:
a. The identity of equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch [21 CFR 111.260(b)];
b. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in the producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)];
c. The unique identifier that you assigned to the packaging and label used [21 CFR 111.260(d)];
d. A statement of the actual yield [21 CFR 11.260(f)];
e. The actual results obtained during any monitoring operations [21 CFR 111.260(g)];
f. The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)];
g. Documentation that the finished dietary supplements meets specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination and for packaging and labeling [21 CFR 111.260(i)];
h. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacturing of the batch including:i. The initials of the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure or each component used in the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(ii)];ii. The initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(iv);
i. Documentation, at the time of the performance, or packaging and labeling operations, including:i. The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labeling used, and then label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels [21 CFR 111.260(k)(1)];ii. An actual or representative label, or cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the master manufacturing records [21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)];iii. The results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements, or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results [21 CFR 111.260(k)(3)];
j. Documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel:i. Reviewed the batch production record [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)];ii. Approved and rejected any reprocessing or repackaging [21 CFR 111.260(l)(2)];iii. Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including the any reprocessed batch [21 CFR 111.260(l)(4)];
k. Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)]; and
l. Documentation at the time of performance of any reprocessing [21 CFR 111.260(n)].
6. You failed to collect and hold reserve samples of each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements that you distribute, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(a).Specifically, you did not collect and hold reserve samples of your multi-tincture formulas, including your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis and Immune Tonic.
In addition, you failed to collect and hold reserve samples for each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements you distribute in the same container-closure system in which the packaged and labeled dietary supplement is distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(b)(1). Specifically, although you collect and hold reserve samples of your single ingredient tinctures, you hold these samples in(b)(4); however, these products are shipped out in different 1-ounce, 2-ounce, 4-ounce, 16-ounce, 32-ounce, and 1-gallon amber bottles.
We have reviewed your response, which included a copy of the Children’s Tonsils & Ears Formula MMR, and find the corrective action to be inadequate to address the violation. The MMR states that the reserve sample is collected and bottled from the batch before the rest of the product is(b)(4)and has(b)(4)added to it. A reserve sample must be a representative sample of product, which means it must accurately portray the material being sampled (see 21 CFR 111.3). A reserve sample taken from a batch before that batch is(b)(4)and has additional ingredients added to it is not representative of that batch.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your Acute Kidney Stone Relief, Adult Cold & Flu, Allergy Aid, Antifungal Formula, Baby Cold & Flu, Children’s Antibiotic Formula, Children’s Asthma Formula, Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis, Hemorrhoid Remedial, Pregnancy Cold and Flu Formula, Prostate Formula, Special Lyme Formula, Immune Tonic, Children’s Allergy Relief Formula, Lung Tonic COPD, Fibromyalgia Formula, Hepatitis C Formula Glycerite, Kidney Stone Remedial, PCOS Formula, Anti-Amoeba Formula, Children’s Antiparasite, Children’s Antifungal Formula, Antiparasite Formula, and Male Fertility Tonic products are misbranded dietary supplement within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Acute Kidney Stone Relief, Adult Cold & Flu, Allergy Aid, Antifungal Formula, Baby Cold & Flu, Children’s Antibiotic Formula, Children’s Asthma Formula, Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis, Hemorrhoid Remedial, Pregnancy Cold and Flu Formula, Prostate Formula, Special Lyme Formula, Immune Tonic, and Male Fertility Tonic products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual name (standardized common name) or Latin binomial of each ingredient (in the absence of a standardized common name per Herbs of Commerce) used as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h).
2. Your Children’s Allergy Relief Formula and Special Lyme Formula products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 343(q)(1)(A)], because the serving size declared on the labels are incorrect and/or incomplete. Serving Size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
a. Your Special Lyme Formula product label states “Suggested dosage: 10 drops 3x daily…”, but the serving size list 15 drops.b. Your Children’s Allergy Relief Formula product label states “Dosage: 10-20 drops every 2 hours for 2 days, then 4 times a day”, but the serving size list 30 drops.c. Your product labels fail to follow the common measure with the equivalent metric quantity as required by 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7)
3. Your Immune Tonic, Kidney Stone Remedial, Lung Tonic COPD, Fibromyalgia Formula, and Hepatitis C Formula Glycerite products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. Specifically, the product labels fail to include the “Servings Per Container” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
4. Your PCOS Formula, Children’s Asthma Formula, Anti-Amoeba Formula, Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis, and Children’s Antiparasite products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) the Act [21 U.S.C § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. The title “Supplement Facts” on your product labels is not set full width of the nutrition label as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).b. Your product labels lack a heavy bar beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(i).c. Your product labels do not meet the requirements under 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2) and (c)(3), respectively in that the other dietary ingredients contained in the “Proprietary Blend” or other appropriate descriptive term are not declared indented under the “Proprietary Blend” in descending order of predominance by weight, and in a column or linear fashion.
Furthermore, your proprietary blends declare glycerin, water, and ethanol as dietary ingredients when it appears they are functioning as food additives and/or solvents.d. Your product labels fail to declare the amount of proprietary blend per serving, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii).e. The heading, “Amount Per Serving,” fails to be bolded and placed above the listed quantitative amount per serving in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).f. The symbol that precedes “Daily value not established” fails to also be placed following the quantitative amount per serving of the proprietary blend rather than next to the word “Extract” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(3).g. Your Children’s Tonsillitis/Otitis product fails to declare the “Other ingredients” below the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g).
b) Your Antiparasite Formula, Children’s Antifungal Formula, and Children’s Antiparasite products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [U.S.C. § 343(w)] because the labels fail to declare the major food allergen “black walnut” as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act.
Section 201(pp) of the Act [U.S.C. § 321(qq)] defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agriculture commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
a. The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food sources from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients, section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(w)(1)(A)]; orb. The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived [e.g. “Black Walnut” (Tree Nut)], except the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source, or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen), section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, your Antiparasite Formula, Children’s Antifungal Formula, and Children’s Antiparasite product labels include “Contains a tree nut (Black Walnut)” on the principal display panel and the major allergen does not parenthetically follow the food source name”. Furthermore, a “Contains” statement must be printed immediately after, or adjacent to, the ingredient list. We note, that if a “Contains” statement is used to declare the source of the tree nut we would not object to just the type of tree nut being declared, e.g., “Contains black walnuts.”

WARNING LETTER
Reference: CMS Case # 642819
Dear Mr. Gygi:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your manufacturing facility, located at 2030 N Redwood Rd, Suite 70, Salt Lake City, UT 84116 on August 17, 18, 22, and 24, 2022, and we also reviewed labels for your products,(b)(4)and(b)(4). Based on inspectional findings and a review of your labels for(b)(4)and(b)(4), we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
At the close of the inspection, on August 24, 2022, our investigator provided you with a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations (FDA 483). Our investigator subsequently issued an amended FDA 483 on August 29, 2022. To date, we have not received a response to the FDA 483.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility on August 17, 18, 22, and 24, 2022, revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on these violations, these products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish a specification for every point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, for the(b)(4)and(b)(4)products:
a. You failed to establish component specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b);
b. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
Once you have established the required specifications, you must take specific actions to determine whether those specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75, and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, your firm lacks written procedures for quality control operations.
Once you have established your quality control written procedures, you must implement quality control operations in your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.65.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, you do not have MMRs for your(b)(4)and(b)(4)products. Additionally, your MMR must include all required elements of 21 CFR 111.210.
4. Your batch production records (BPRs) did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each dietary supplement batch that you manufacture, and did not include all information required in a BPR, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your BPRs for the(b)(4)(lot numbers(b)(4)and(b)(4)) and(b)(4)(lot numbers(b)(4)and(b)(4)) products you manufacture under contract failed to include the following information:a. The identity of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch [21 CFR 111.260(b)]. For example, you use a blender and pH meter in your manufacturing process; however, you did not document the identity of this equipment.
b. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)]
c. The unique identifier that you assigned to each component, packaging, and label used [21 CFR 111.260(d)]
d. A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing [21 CFR 111.260(f)]
e. Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including:i. The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and, when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels [21 CFR 111.260(k)(1)]ii. An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)]
f. Documentation, at the time of performance, of:i. The initials of the person responsible for adding each component to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(iii)];ii. The initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of the components to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(iv)];
g. Documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control personnel:i. Reviewed the batch production record [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)];ii. Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution [21 CFR 111.260(l)(3)];iii. Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)(4)].
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distribution operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, you have not established written procedures for holding and distributing operations.
6. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for calibrating instruments and controls that you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.25(a). Specifically, you have not established written procedures for calibrating instruments and controls that you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement.
Once you have established the required calibration procedures, you must calibrate instruments and controls you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement before use, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.27(b).
7. You failed to make and keep documentation of employee training, as required by 21 CFR 111.14(b)(2). Specifically, you do not document employee training, including the date of the training, the type of training, and the person(s) trained
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined the(b)(4)and(b)(4)products you manufacture are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the product labels are false or misleading. Specifically, the product labels state that the products contain(b)(4), and “(b)(4)”. This information is false because your BPRs do not include these ingredients as part of the formulation for these products.
2. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that these product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example, according to your BPRs, both products are formulated with(b)(4), and(b)(4)is formulated with(b)(4). However, none of these ingredients is declared on the labels.
3. The(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(k)] because the product contains artificial coloring but fails to bear labeling stating that fact. Your BPRs for this product list an artificial(b)(4)flavor and this ingredient contains several subingredients, including(b)(4). However, the(b)(4)product label fails to declare the presence of this color additive using its listed name or appropriate abbreviation, as required by 21 CFR 101.22(k)(1).
4. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example,
a. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)product labels list(b)(4)within the list of (b)(3)-dietary ingredients in the Supplement Facts panel. A (b)(2)-dietary ingredient must not be listed with the (b)(3)-dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and (b)(3).
b. The(b)(4)product label declares 27 calories. The amount must be expressed in the increments specified in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(A).
5.

Re: 650718
Dear Randall Thomason and Jane Laulis:
This letter concerns your firm’s marketing of unapproved new animal drug products for the treatment of disease in animals, including but not limited to, “Desert Defense Original Formula, Yeast, Fungal & Mold Support, and SuperBo Wellness Formula”. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website at the internet address www.desert-defense.com and www.rogueresearch.com/ in November and December 2022 and has determined that you distribute this product there. We have also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/Desert.Defense.Valley.Fever/ where you direct consumers to your website at www.desert-defense.com to purchase products.
Based on our review of your website and social media, your “Desert Defense” products are a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)], because this product is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. As explained further below, these products are an unapproved new animal drug and introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage atwww.fda.gov.
1. Examples of claims observed on your www.desert-defense.com website that show the intended uses of your “Desert Defense” products include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From your website www.desert-defense.com: Webpage titled – “Desert Defense Dogs | A First Line of Defense Against Valley Fever for Your Dog”
“A First Line of Defense Against Valley Fever for Your Dog”
“Desert Defense provides nutritional support for prevention or active cases of Valley Fever.”
“Desert DEFENSE™ for Dogs was designed and tested to boost your dog’s natural defenses against the unique host of fungal, parasitic, viral and bacterial pathogens that flourish in the desert southwest.”
“Desert DEFENSE™ | A Multi-Nutrient Formula For Dogs | A Holistic Defense Against | VALLEY FEVER | and other pathogenic invaders”
From your website www.desert-defense.com: Webpage titled – “Internet Orders | Desert Defense Dogs”
“Level 1: Original– this is for dogs with active Valley Fever infections and can be used for preventative support but we prefer Level 2 for that. You may use this product with drugs with your vet’s approval and also as support to minimize the relapse cycle as your dog goes off drugs.”
Level 2: Yeast, Fungal & Mold Support– this is for preventive support, mild to moderate cases of Valley Fever and intact canines. If you are visiting Arizona use this for support at lower doses for protection.”
Level 3: SuperBotanical Wellness– this is for dogs that are mature and have lived in the prime Valley Fever conditions without issues for year and senior pets. It is very mild.”
“Desert Defense Original Formula $59.95 plus shipping 157 gm 5.5 oz Green label. This is our Original formula .... This formula is most appropriate for dogs that are sick and have lethargy as one of the issues. DD Original is our strongest formula. DD Original has been clinically tested and have been proven to reduce titers and symptoms in dogs suffering for Valley Fever.”
From your website www.desert-defense.com: Webpage titled – “Desert Defense Dogs… Products”
“Level 1: Original– this is for dogs with active Valley Fever infections and can be used for preventative support but we prefer Level 2 for that. You may use this product with drugs with your vet’s approval and also as support to minimize the relapse cycle as your dog goes off drugs.”
“NEW PRODUCT: ORIGINAL STAGE 2 – The same strong product as Original but for dogs that do not have lethargy as an issue.”
“Level 2: Yeast, Fungal & Mold Support – this is for preventive support, mild to moderate cases of Valley Fever and intact canines. If you are visiting Arizona use this for support at lower doses for protection.”
“Level 3: SuperBotanical Wellness – this is for dogs that are mature and have lived in the prime Valley Fever conditions without issue for years and senior pets. It is very mild.”
“ORGANIC ORIGINAL FORMULA5.5 and 11 oz sizes | This is our Original formula …. This formula is most appropriate for dogs that are sick and have lethargy as one of the issues. DD Original is our strongest formula so we do not recommend this for maintenance. Instead use one or the other of the products listed above. DD Original has been clinically tested and has been proven to reduce titers and symptoms in dogs suffering from Valley Fever.”
From your website www.desert-defense.com: Webpage titled – “FAQS & BLOG | Desert Defense Dogs”:
“Postings on 12/18/12: Q: My dog has Valley Fever and my vet is recommending fluconazole. Is it safe to use your product? A: First always check with your veterinarian before introducing any supplementation in combination with a drug program. We did develop Desert Defense to be used in conjunction with fluconazole. In some cases it seems that it might greatly enhance the absorption of the drug. WE [sic] still always recommend a very slow loading period at small amounts to ensure no adverse reactions. We have had numerous reports from veterinarians and pet owners that the addition of Desert Defense vastly improved symptoms and titers.”
""Q: Does Desert Defense prevent Valley Fever? A: We developed this product as support for dogs with active cases of Valley Fever. It is virtually impossible for us to determine if it actually prevents Valley Fever… What we are trying to do is provide your dog as many tools as possible to keep a strong, sound immune system.”
“Q: Should I use Sensitive or the Original formula for my dog? A: Initially we had one formula. … So the best recommendation is that if your dog is “sick” with Valley Fever please use the Original formula with your Veterinarian’s approval. If your dogs are exposed and carrying a titer then please use either Sensitive (now called Yeast, Fungal & Mold Support) or our new SuperBo/Basic formulas.”

3. From your social media website www.facebook.com/Desert.Defense.Valley.Fever: Webpage titled – “Desert Defense | Facebook”:
Your Facebook cover and profile photo states:
o “Desert DefenseTMfor dogs was designed and tested to boost your dogs natural defenses against the unique host of fungal, parasitic, viral, and bacterial pathogens that flourish in the desert southwest.”o “A First Line of Defense Against Valley Fever…”
On February 24, 2020 you posted: “…She cared for him 24/7 and did research to find the best products to help him beat Valley Fever. One of the products she made sure he had every single day was Desert Defense!”
Comment on post from October 13, 2019 – commenter states, “We have not have [sic] one dog get Valley Fever since we started using it as a preventative in 2014.” Your response: “… such great news – thank you!”

His vet immediately put him on fluconazole and other meds for his eyes, ears, and stomach. We were unable to take him home until all but the valley fever had cleared up. On a recheck appointment with his vet, she suggested Desert Defense. … Another titer taken about a week ago showed he had gone from 1:256 to an amazing 1:32. We are certain, as is his vet, that the Desert Defense and his meds have made a tremendous difference and will continue with his treatments in the hope that he will someday not need them anymore.”
On September 16, 2016 you posted: “Important information: Another veterinarian taking a dog off of anti-fungal drugs and using only Desert Defense and the results are astonishing. We are hearing from more and more pet parents that it's their veterinarian that recommends DD.”
These products are new animal drugs, as defined by section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)], because they are not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. They are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. Therefore, the products are unsafe within the meaning of section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5)].

WARNING LETTER
February 10, 2023
CMS# 631597
Dear Dr. Duong:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 2205 Executive Drive, Garland, TX 75041 from February 15, 2022 through March 17, 2022, and we also reviewed labels for your products. Based on inspectional findings, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
We received your written response dated March 29, 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We have reviewed that document and our comments on your response are listed following each of the significant violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed significant violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish the required specifications for each component used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b). Specifically, you did not establish specifications for the components used for your dietary supplement products. For example, you have not established component specifications for the identity of the following dietary ingredients:
•Thorough Wax Extract used in Hawthorn Plus, Super Dandelion Capsules, and Thorough Wax Extract product;•American Ginseng Extract used in Thorough Wax Extract;•Oyster Extract used in King Kong and Thorough Wax Extract;•Ginger Root used in Happy Smile Herb Blend;•Prunella Vulgaris used in Stomach Miracle;•Mulberry Leaf used in Stomach Miracle, Wooly, and Vital; and Bitter Almond Extract used in Almond Plus.
We have reviewed your response dated March 29, 2022. You state that you are obtaining monographs for ingredients from “(b)(4)” and that you are identifying tests and testing equipment such as HPLC; however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide documentation to show that your firm has established component specifications.
2. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you provided a product list with approximately 50 different types of products in different tablet or capsule numbers. You provided a sheet with a list of ingredients and weights for approximately 12 of your products. Your “specification sheets” only indicate the ingredients and weights.
We have reviewed your response dated March 29, 2022, and it is inadequate. With regards to your response for finished product identity specifications, your proposed corrective action of using organoleptic attributes (feel and color) along with microscopic photos of the powder within your capsules does not provide sufficient detail for your firm to be able confirm the identity of the finished product, and it does not ensure that you can distinguish one product from any other mix of powdered substances.
3. You failed to establish MMRs for your products that include all elements required by 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMR for your products Stomach Miracle, Thorough Wax Extract, and Almond Plus, failed to include the information required by 21 CFR 111.210, such as:
•The name of the dietary supplement to be manufactured and the strength, concentration, weight, or measure of each dietary ingredient for each batch size, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(a);•A complete list of components to be used, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(b);•An accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(c);•The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(d);•A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(e);•A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g);•Written instructions, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h), including the following:
o Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1);o Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(2);o Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3).▪Such specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i); and▪For manual operations, such specific actions must include, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii):•One person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A);and•One person adding the component and another person verifying the addition, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B).
o Special notations and precautions to be followed, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(4); ando Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5).
4. You failed to prepare a batch production record every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). Specifically, during the inspection, your firm did not have batch production records (BPRs) for all products that had been manufactured, such as Almond Plus and Stomach Miracle.
5. Your BPRs for Stomach Miracle, Thorough Wax Extract, and Almond Plus did not include complete information as required by 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your BPRs lack:•The unique identifier that you assigned to each component (or, when applicable, to a product that you receive from a supplier for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement), packaging, and label used, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(d);•A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing as required by 21 CFR 111.260(f);•The actual results obtained during any monitoring operation as required by 21 CFR 111.260(g);•The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results as required by 21 CFR 111.260(h);•Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with Sec. 111.70(e) and (g) as required by 21 CFR 111.260(i);•Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including:•The date on which each step of the master manufacturing record was performed; and The initials of the persons performing each step, including: The initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch; The initials of the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure of each component used in the batch; The initials of the person responsible for adding the component to the batch; and The initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch results as required by 21 CFR 111.260 (j);•Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including: The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and, when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels; An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the master manufacturing record; and The results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements (including repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements), or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results as required by 21 CFR 111.260(k);•Documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel: Reviewed the batch production record, including: Review of any monitoring operation required under subpart E of this part; and Review of the results of any tests and examinations, including tests and examinations conducted on components, in-process materials, finished batches of dietary supplements, and packaged and labeled dietary supplements; Approved or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging; and Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch; and Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement, including any repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l);•Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.260 (m); and•Documentation at the time of performance of any reprocessing as required by 21 CFR 111.260(n).
In your response from March 29, 2022, you state that you are planning to implement electronic batch production records. You did not provide an example or documents showing your implementation of electronic batch production records, so we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions.7. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements of Subpart O (Product Complaints), as required by 21 CFR 111.553. Specifically, you provided the investigator with a “Return Policy for product Complaints.” The policy states that you refund or exchange the product, that you refer to the “Batch Production Record” and that your quality control personnel reexamine the batch “to ensure [whether] the batch was contaminated.” It also states that if multiple reports and complaints are received “in a(b)(4)time span,” that the batch will be sent to a laboratory for testing. Your product complaint procedures failed to include that a qualified person will review all product complaints (not only on the basis of returned products) and will investigate any product complaint that involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of this part, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury, not only when you have multiple reports or complaints, as required by 21 CFR 111.560(a).
8. Your firm failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, your firm did not establish written procedures that included procedures to follow for conducting a material review and make a disposition decision for each lot of finished dietarysupplement products manufactured and distributed under your own label name, American Chinese Natural Herbs.
Your firm’s March 29, 2022, response stated that you are in the process of developing new standard operating procedures however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide examples of those new standard operating procedures.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, we reviewed product labels collected during the inspection and have determined that your Almond Plus (300 Pills), Almond Plus (600 pills), Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), LIV-97, Yellow Dragon, King Kong, Vital, Happy Smile Herb Blend, Hawthorn Plus, Thorough Wax Extract, Woolly, and Super Dandelion Capsules products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Almond Plus (300 pills) product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36(a). For example, your Almond Plus (300 pills) product label fails to present the nutrition information in the form of a supplement facts label.
2. Your Almond Plus (300 pills) product is misbranded within the meaning of 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (s)(2)(B)] because it does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).3. Your Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills), Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), LIV-97, Yellow Dragon, King Kong, Vital, Happy Smile Herb Blend, Hawthorn Plus, Thorough Wax Extract, Woolly, and Super Dandelion Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the label fails to declare the common or usual name of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.4 and 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
•Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills):o Declares red date and melissa but fails to declare the standardized common names jujube and lemon balm, respectively, as listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce (HOC).o Declares mimosa, but this is not the common or usual name of a dietary ingredient.o Sand is not in HOC; therefore, the Latin binomial must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(h)(2).
•Happy Smile Herb Blend:o Declares glehniae, patriniae, longanae, ophiopogonis, polygalae, and astragail, but the standardized common names must be stated in English as glehnia, patrinia, longan, ophiopogon, polygala, and astragalus, respectively.o Declares Ganoderma lucidum, Poria cocos, Zizphy spinosae, Nelumbinis, red date, and Coicis, but fails to declare the standardized common names reishi, poria, jujube, sacred lotus, jujube, and Job’s tears, respectively, as listed in HOC.o Declares concha pteriae and atralodis, but these are not the common or usual names of dietary ingredients.
•Hawthorn Plus:o Declares nut grass, thorough wax, tree of heaven, and Indian bread, but fails to declare the standardized common names Cyperus, bupleurum, Chinese tree-ofheaven or Indian tree-of-heaven, and poria, respectively, as listed in HOC.o Batavia and sand are not in HOC; therefore, the Latin binomial must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(h)(2).

4. Your Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills), Happy Smile Herb Blend, Hawthorn Plus, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), King Kong, LIV-97, Vital, Super Dandelion Plus, Thorough Wax Extract, Woolly, and Yellow Dragon products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d)(1) and 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example:
•Happy Smile Herb Blend, Hawthorn Plus, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), Super Dandelion Capsules, and Vital:o Not all ingredients indicate the plant part used. The label must list the English name of the plant part; for example, root instead of radix. Furthermore, herb (herba) does not describe the plant part; if the entire plant is used, indicate this by stating “whole plant.”
•Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills):o Red date, bitter almond, and wild yam do not indicate the plant part used.
•King Kong:o Asparagus extract, aged red ginseng extract, Dried Seal Extract, and Achyranthes Extract ingredients do not indicate the plant part used.
•LIV-97:o Artemissa [sic], Jasmine, dragons blood, Neroli, Tree of Heaven, Oldenlandia, Honey Suckle [sic] ingredients do not indicate the plant part.
•Thorough Wax Extract:o Thorough Wax Extract, Water Lavage [sic] Extract, American Ginseng Extract, and Origanum Extract do not indicate the plant part used.•Woolly:o Woolly grass, bitter orange, and shave grass do not indicate the plant part used.
•Yellow Dragon:o Sea dragon extract, Indian bread extract, achyranthes extract, and water plantain extract do not indicate the plant part used.
5. Your Happy Smile Herb Blend products, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), and Vital products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because the product labels contain information in two languages but do not repeat all the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreigncharacters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
6. Your Happy Smile Herb Blend and Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), and Vital products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] because the labels are false and misleading. Specifically:
•Your Happy Smile Herb Blend product label states each capsule contains 500 mg and the serving size is 3 capsules with the amount per serving as 1,500 mg, but the sum of the dietary ingredients listed in the Supplement Facts is 765 mg,. Therefore, according to list in the Supplement Facts panel, the amount per capsule would be 255 mg, which does not match the 500 mg listed on the label.•Your Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), product labels state each capsule contains 500 mg and the serving size is 3 capsules with the amount per serving as 1,500 mg, but the sum of the dietary ingredients listed in the Supplement Facts is 1150 mg. Therefore, according to list in the Supplement Facts panel, the amount per capsule would be 383 mg, which does not match the 500 mg listed on the label.
•Your Vital product label states each capsule contains 500 mg and the serving size is 3 capsules with the amount per serving as 1,500 mg, but the sum of the dietary ingredients listed in the Supplement Facts is 1210 mg. Therefore, according to list in the Supplement Facts panel, the amount per capsule would be 403 mg, which does not match the 500 mg listed on the label.
7. Your Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills), King Kong, LIV-97, Thorough Wax Extract, and Yellow Dragon products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Specifically:
•Your Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills) product label fails to list the serving size.•Your King Kong product label suggests consumers take 3-5 pills twice daily, but the serving size is 3 pills. The serving size should be 5 pills.•Your LIV-97 product label suggests consumers take 8-12 pills twice daily, but the serving size is 3 pills. The serving size should be 12 pills.•Your Thorough Wax Extract product label directs consumers to take 3-6 capsules 2 times daily, but the serving size is 3 capsules. The serving size should be 6 capsules.•Your Yellow Dragon product label suggests consumers take 2-5 capsules twice daily, but the serving size is 2 capsules. The serving size should be 5 capsules.
8. Your Almond Plus (300 pills and 600 pills), Hawthorn Plus, LIV-97, Super Dandelion Capsules, Thorough Wax Extract, Woolly, and Yellow Dragon products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(A)(ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (s)(2)(A)(ii)] in that the product label fails to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving size of each dietary ingredient or fails to include the total quantitative amount by weight perserving size of all dietary ingredients in a proprietary blend as required by 21 CFR 101.36.
9. Your LIV-97, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), Thorough Wax Extract, and Yellow Dragon products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b). For example: Your product labels do not bear a symbol next to all structure/function claims linking the claims to the FDA disclaimer.
10. Your Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules) and Happy Smile Herb Blend products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product labels fail to declare the major food allergen oyster. Section 201(qq) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(qq)], defines milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient thatcontains protein derived from one of these foods, with the exception of highly refined oils as “major food allergens.” A food is misbranded under section 403(w) of the Act if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
•The word “Contains” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or adjacent to the list of ingredients, section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or•The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived [e.g. “Whey (Milk)”], except the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source, or the name of the food source appears else-where in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen), section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
We offer the following comments:
1. Your Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules) and Vital product labels bear the statement of identity as “Herbal Food Supplement.” While “Herbal Supplement” is an appropriate statement of identity, the term “Food Supplement” is not appropriate because it does not identify or describe the dietary ingredients or combination of ingredients that the product supplies. Your Hawthorn Plus product label misspells the dietary ingredient betelnut and your Yellow Dragon label misspells the dietary ingredient teasel.
2. Your Happy Smile Herb Blend, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), Super Dandelion Capsules, Vital, and Woolly product labels list Other Ingredients: Gelatin (capsule) within the Supplement Facts label. The ingredients list should be located outside and directly below the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g).
3. Your Happy Smile Herb Blend, Hawthorn Plus, Stomach Miracle (120 capsules and 270 capsules), Super Dandelion Capsules, Vital, and Woolly product labels fail to indent the dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend under the term “Proprietary Blend” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).
4. Your Thorough Wax Extract product label’s information panel includes nutrition information intermingled with information that is considered intervening material. An example of intervening material is “Product contains no sugar, starch, ….” All information appearing on the information panel of the product label should appear in one place without other intervening material [21 CFR 101.2(e)].
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.Please send your written response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Chad J. Whitwell, Compliance Officer, at the following email: Chad.Whitwell@fda.hhs.gov (preferred) or you may also mail a hard copy addressed to Chad J.

WARNING LETTER
December 13, 2022RE: 637182
Dear Raymundo Osuna,
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 300 N. Macarthur Blvd, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, from June 7, 2022, through June 13, 2022. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your product labels, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
We received your written response, dated July 5, 2022, to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We have reviewed that document and our comments are listed following each of the significant violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on the inspection, we determined that your products, including your(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to the following:
1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity and purity of the finished batch of the dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you told our investigator that you have created finished product specifications for your(b)(4)and(b)(4)products; however, these specifications fail to include established specifications for the identity and purity of each of the products.
We acknowledge your response, which states, “Raw materials and finished product shall be tested for identity, purity, or composition as stated in the revised SOP…The Quality Department will be working with the labs to establish specifications for identity, purity, and composition for finished products.” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide finished product specifications for our review.
2. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, you provided MMRs for the(b)(4)and(b)(4). You also provided batch production records (BPR) for two lots of(b)(4)and two lots of(b)(4). With the exception of one lot of the(b)(4), none of the BPRs matched the MMRs for the products. As such, the BPRs do not support that you are preparing and following written MMRs for each unique formulation and batch size of dietary supplement that you manufacture. In preparing the MMRs, they must include the required elements of 21 CFR 111.210.
We reviewed your response in which you state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP revised and implement the new process in place within the next 90 days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any MMRs for any manufactured dietary supplement for our review.
3. You failed to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, your firm’s BPRs for the(b)(4)(lots(b)(4)and(b)(4)) and(b)(4)(lots(b)(4)and(b)(4)) indicate that the supplement products contain multiple dietary ingredients; however, during inspection, you stated that you verify the strength for only one dietary ingredient in each of the dietary supplements. Selecting only one of multiple dietary ingredients in the supplement products does not verify your production and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that meets the required product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement.
We reviewed your response in which you state, “Quality Supplement Manufacturing will have the SOP revised and implement the new process in place within the next 90 days.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any standard operating procedures for review.
4. You failed to ensure all tests and examinations that are used to determine whether a specification is met are appropriate and scientifically valid in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically, you stated “the only analysis for the finished product is by input and a(b)(4)test.” The input of the various dietary ingredients during production and subsequent analysis of a single dietary ingredient alone in the finished product is not sufficient to verify specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition in a finished product because inputting specific amounts of various ingredients during manufacturing does not ensure that specifications are met in the finished product, nor does later testing for a single dietary ingredient assess any other components within the finished product.
5. Your quality control personnel did not reject a component and dietary supplement for which a specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.77(a), nor did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing that would ensure the quality of the finished dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement would be packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR. You have in-process specifications within your MMR for fill weights of capsules and tablets to ensure that the finished product meets the label declarations. In several instances, your product neither met these specifications nor were they approved for an appropriate treatment, in-process adjustment, or reprocessing. For example:
o The tablet run sheet for(b)(4)(lot(b)(4)) includes out of specification fill weights. The BPR states the fill weight range is(b)(4)mg. The tablet run sheet has weights throughout in the(b)(4)range and notes “tablet won’t hit the weight so running(b)(4).” A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit was not documented.
o The capsule run sheet for(b)(4)(lot(b)(4)) includes out of specification fill weights. The BPR states the fill weight range as(b)(4)mg. The QC capsule run sheet has fill weights listed at(b)(4)mg,(b)(4)mg,(b)(4)mg and(b)(4)mg. There are several notes that adjustments are being made but no corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit addresses the underweight capsules.
We have reviewed your written response in which you state that the root cause for the out of specification fill weights for your(b)(4)product was “lack of training” and that you would be “revising your sample run process” along with “[a] new SOP…to explain the sample run process and how to run deviations.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any training records for review, new SOPs, or other documentation on your new sample run or deviation process.
6. Your quality control personnel failed to reject the component, dietary supplement, package, or label, when a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70 is not met, nor did they approve a permitted treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). For example, your finished product test for your(b)(4)(lot(b)(4)) includes strength analysis for the dietary ingredient(b)(4). The product specification for the ingredient in the supplement products is(b)(4)mg/tablet. An out of specification result of(b)(4)mg/tablet was reported by your contract lab(b)(4). A corrective action approved by the firm’s quality unit was not documented.
We have reviewed your written response in which you state that “[the] Quality Department will be signing off on all finished product test results.” We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide any test result records or other documentation to show the implementation of the new procedure.
7. Your quality control operations for the MMR, the BPR, and manufacturing operations failed to include approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(5). For example,(b)(4)barrels of(b)(4)tablets (lot(b)(4)) were returned to the blending stage for grinding; however, the BPR does not include documentation showing that your quality control operations approved or rejected any reprocessing.
8. Your quality control failed to document in the BPR at the time of performance the approval and release, or the rejection of a batch of dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l)(3). For example, BPRs for(b)(4)(lot(b)(4)and(b)(4)) do not include documentation that your quality control personnel approved and released, or rejected, the batches for distribution.Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, even if your(b)(4)product was not an unapproved new and misbranded drug, this product and others would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements.Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your(b)(4)and(b)(4)dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of nutrition information on the labeling for your products does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements in 21 CFR 101.36. For example,
o Your(b)(4)Facts label fails to declare the source of the(b)(4). (21 CFR 101.36(d))
o Your(b)(4)Facts label incorrectly declares as a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, “(b)(4)”. 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) lists an RDI for(b)(4)of(b)(4)mcg based on the AI (adequate intake) that pertains only to(b)(4).(b)(4)should be listed as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredient.
o Your(b)(4)product fails to declare the source of the(b)(4)as indicated in the master manufacturing record; e.g.,(b)(4)(as(b)(4)). (21 CFR 101.36(d))
o Your(b)(4)fails to express the metric quantitative amounts by weight per serving of other dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A); for example,(b)(4)mg should be(b)(4)g.
o Your(b)(4)fails to declare the quantitative amount of(b)(4)with the % Daily Value based upon the presence of(b)(4)in the product formula, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)
2. Your(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)], in that the finished product labels fail to declare the major food allergen, shrimp and crab, as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act. Specifically, as you have chosen to use a “Contains” statement, you must declare the specific type of Crustacean shellfish.
3. Your(b)(4)product and(b)(4)products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically,
o Your(b)(4)Facts label declares the(b)(4)but fails to state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” as listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce, as incorporated by 21 CFR 101.4(h).
o Your(b)(4)product’s ingredient list declares “flavorless coating (Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1)” which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient. Furthermore, your batch production records for the product indicate “(b)(4)” as an ingredient but this ingredient does not appear in the ingredient list of your product label.
o Your(b)(4)Facts label declares the(b)(4)but fails to state the standardized common name “(b)(4)” as listed in Herbs of Commerce. [See 21 CFR 101.4(h)] Furthermore, the source ingredient(b)(4)fails to be listed first within the parentheses, and then followed by the(b)(4)name within parentheses; for example,(b)(4)
4. Your(b)(4)product label is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761 of the Act) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: CMS # 643997
Dear Ms. Wiegert:
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://organicheirloomplants.com in October 2022. We also reviewed your promotional literature that accompanies your products and your social media website at https://facebook.com/godgivenherbalremedies, where you direct consumers to your website, https://organicheirloomplants.com, to purchase your products Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Ivermectwin, Nature’s Ancer, Zeolite, and Chaga Mushroom. Based on our review, the claims on your websites and promotional literature establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has determined that a public health emergency exists nationwide involving mpox.1,2Therefore, FDA is taking measures to protect customers from products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure mpox in people. We request that you cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of mpox.

Your Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Nature’s Ancer, Ivermectwin, Zeolite, and Chaga Mushroom products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Nature’s Ancer, Ivermectwin, Zeolite, and Chaga Mushroom products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Sarracenia Purpurea, Breathe Rite H2O2 Therapy, Nature’s Ancer, Ivermectwin, Zeolite, and Chaga Mushroom products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your product is not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to Sara Dent Acosta, Compliance Officer, United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5001 Campus Drive, Office of Compliance (HFS-608), Division of Enforcement, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835 or via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER 635400
In reply, refer to CMS 635400
Dear Mr. Michael T. Shields and Ms. Windy N. Shields:
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 2215 E Germann Rd, Chandler, Arizona, from April 11 through April 27, 2022. Based on the inspectional findings we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page atwww.fda.gov.
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. In addition, the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)and(b)(4)brand(b)(4)(in(b)(4)and(b)(4)sizes) dietary supplement products that you manufacture are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343].
FDA acknowledges the receipt of your e-mail correspondence dated May 20, 2022 and June 23, 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. Not all of the items on the issued Form FDA 483 were addressed in your response. We address your response below, in relation to the applicable violations to which you responded.
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish an identity specification for your(b)(4)used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product. Your raw material data sheet for(b)(4)states “(b)(4)Potency” as the specification for identity, but this does not establish standards to confirm the identity of the component used in the manufacture of your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Additionally, your raw material data sheet for(b)(4)used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product has five minerals in the blend but your purported ICP-MS specification for identity lists “mineral detected” as the specification and fails to establish standards which can be used to confirm the identity of the(b)(4)component, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1).
2. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity and composition of the dietary supplement manufactured using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, you have not established specifications for the(b)(4)Premix used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product and specifications for several of the components used in the manufacture of the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product to ensure that specifications for purity and composition of these products are met.
We have reviewed your June 23, 2022 response to the form FDA 483. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation demonstrating you have established specifications in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1) and 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). You provide documents you describe as revised finished product specifications for the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product and(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product. We note that these documents do not demonstrate that you have established specifications that provide standards to confirm the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of your dietary supplements. For example, the finished product specification for(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product lists an “identification” specification of “Conforms to Standard” with a test method of “Eurofins or eq.” and a frequency of “Rotational.” “Conforms to standard” does not specify the extent to which the component must conform. “Eurofins or eq.” is not a test method and “Rotational” does not describe the frequency of when testing is to occur.
Similarly, the finished product specification for your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product states testing “Frequency” as “Rotation” for several components, and does not describe the frequency of when testing is to occur.
3. You failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, for use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, the FTIR analysis performed by your third-party laboratory uses previous shipments of components as the reference for testing and they do not own a reference library for the FTIR tests. Testing components against previous shipments of the component may confirm receipt of the same component but this does not ensure the identity, purity, quality, and strength of the component is thoroughly characterized .
4. Your quality control operations did not approve and release, or reject, each finished batch for distribution as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(8). Specifically, your firm distributed(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product, Lot #(b)(4), without quality control review, approval and release of the finished batch for distribution.
5. Your quality control personnel must not approve and release for distribution any batch of dietary supplement, including any reprocessed batch, that does not meet all product specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e), as required by 21 CFR 111.123(b)(2). Your quality control personnel released(b)(4)brand(b)(4), Lot #(b)(4), when the specification for pH was not met. Specifically, your established finished product specification for pH for the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product is(b)(4)and the pH of the product in Lot #(b)(4)released for distribution was 6.34.
6. Your quality control personnel neither rejected a component or dietary supplement when that component or dietary supplement failed to meet a specification established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70, nor did they approve a treatment, an in-process adjustment, or reprocessing, as permitted in 21 CFR 111.77, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). Specifically,(b)(4)brand(b)(4), Lot #(b)(4), uses(b)(4)and(b)(4)as components. Testing of these two components by a third-party laboratory found both were not within your established specifications. Your quality control personnel failed to reject these components used in the manufacturing of your finished product and failed to reject the(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product, Lot #(b)(4).
7. Your quality control operations failed to approve, and release from quarantine, all components, before they are used as required by 21 CFR 111.120(e). Specifically, your quality control operations approved, and released from quarantine several components used in the manufacture of(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product, Lot #(b)(4), and components used in the manufacture of(b)(4)brand(b)(4), Lot #(b)(4). For example, the raw material data sheets for the components(b)(4), and(b)(4)used in the manufacture of your(b)(4)brand(b)(4), Lot #(b)(4), and the raw material data sheets for the(b)(4)and the(b)(4)used in the manufacture of your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)product, Lot #(b)(4)do not show a disposition by your quality control operations to approve, and release these components for use in manufacturing your finished products.
8. You failed to prepare and follow a master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, which includes all required information, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a) and 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the Master Manufacturing Records for the following(b)(4)brand products which you manufacture were missing the following required elements:
a.(b)(4)Item #(b)(4):i. A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process and the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary. (21 CFR 111.210(f)).ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations. (21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)).
b.(b)(4)Item #(b)(4):i. A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process and the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary. (21 CFR 111.210(f)).ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations. (21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)).
Misbrand Dietary Supplements
1. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)and(b)(4)brand(b)(4)and(b)(4)sizes) products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example,
a. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)) includes a Supplement Facts label with columns for “Amount per Serving (29.6 mL),” “Ages 4+ yrs,” “Pregnant and Lactating,” “Per serving (2.5 mL),” and “Ages 2-3 yrs.” Your “Suggested Use” panel includes different serving instructions for “2-3 Years,” “4-10 Years,” “11-17 Years,” “18 Years+,” and “Pregnant/Lactating & Seniors (65+).” Therefore, your Supplement Facts label fails to list all of the groups of individuals, by age or status (Pregnant/Lactating). for which the products are intended.
b. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)) includes a Supplement Facts label with columns for “Amount per Serving” and “% DV” for unspecified intended consumers; however, your “Suggested Use” panel lists several intended consumers, including “children, 1-3 years,” “Children, 4-13 years,” “Adults, 14-64 years” (the serving size indicated on the Supplement Facts label), and “Pregnant/Lactating and Seniors, 65+.” Therefore, your Supplement Facts label fails to list all of the groups of individuals, by age or status (Pregnant/Lactating), for which the products are intended.
c. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)) product labels use the incorrect unit of measurement for copper for the(b)(4)serving size. The amount must use the unit of measurement given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B).
2. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)and(b)(4)) and(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)and(b)(4)sizes) products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, your product labels only list the serving size for one of the intended consumer groups listed in the “Suggested Use” panel. As your products are intended for several other age groups/categories of individual (Pregnant/Lactating or Senior), you must list the serving size for each group/category in your Supplement Facts label.
3. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)) and(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)and(b)(4)) products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the number of servings per container declared on the label is incorrect. Specifically, your product labels only list the number of servings for one of the intended consumer groups listed in the “Suggested Use” panel. As your products are intended for several other age groups/categories of individuals, you must list the number of servings for each group/category in your Supplement Facts label.
4. Your(b)(4)brand(b)(4)((b)(4)) are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, the label declares trace minerals as part of the proprietary blend, but this is not the common or usual name of a dietary ingredient.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
We also have the following comment:
Based on further review of your product and process information, your firm’s “(b)(4)” products appear to meet the definition of an acidified food (AF) and your firm’s “(b)(4)” products appear to meet the definition of a low-acid canned food (LACF) as defined in 21 CFR Parts 108, 113 and 114. Consequently, your firm may be required to register as an LACF/AF processor and file the necessary scheduled processes with FDA. We recommend working with a process authority to further evaluate your products in order to establish and file scheduled processes in accordance with 21 CFR Part 108.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, DFC Bldg 20 - W. 6th Ave & Kipling St., P.O. Box 25087, Denver, CO 80225, CO, to the attention of Jennifer A. Hicks, Director of Compliance Branch.

Dear Mr. Vizcarrondo:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1460 W. 135th St., Gardena, CA from November 2, 2021, through November 10, 2021. During the inspection, our investigators collected labeling for your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” dietary supplement. Based on our subsequent review of the product labeling, we have concluded that this product is in violation of section 403 of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and the regulations contained within Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 101 (21 CFR Part 101). FDA received your response to FDA’s Form 483, Inspectional Observations, on February 4, 2022. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
1. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(a)(1)] because its labeling is false or misleading. Specifically:
a) Our sampling analysis of your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” dietary supplement(b)(4)independent determinations of potassium. Magnesium and potassium are Class II minerals as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(g)(3). Because your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” dietary supplement does not contain levels of magnesium or potassium at least equal to 80 percent of the value declared on the label for each nutrient, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(g)(4)(ii), the product’s label is false or misleading.
2. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product label bears nutrient content claims but does not meet the requirements to bear such claims. Under sections 403(r)(1)(A) and (2)(A)(i) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of the food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Under 21 CFR 101.13(b), a claim that expressly or implicitly characterizes the level of a nutrient of the type required to be in nutrition labeling under 21 CFR 101.9 or under 21 CFR 101.36 (that is, a nutrient content claim) may not be made on the label or in labeling of foods unless the claim is made in accordance with 21 CFR 101.13 and with the applicable regulations in 21 CFR Part 101 subpart D or in Part 105 or Part 107. An implied nutrient content claim includes any claim that describes the food or an ingredient therein in a manner that suggests that a nutrient is absent or present in a certain amount (21 CFR 101.13(b)(2)(i)). Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act. Specifically,
a) Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label displays the following claim “Canary Seed … is high in protein content.” In the context of this label, FDA considers the claim “Canary Seed . . . is high in protein content” to be an implied claim about the food itself. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.54(b), the terms “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent source of” may be used to characterize the level of a nutrient on the label and in the labeling of foods provided that the food contains 20 percent or more of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or the Daily Reference Value (DRV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC). The DRV for protein is 50 grams (g), and the RACC for your product is 2 Tablespoons. According to the Supplement Facts label, your product contains 2.6 g of protein per 2 Tablespoons, which is only 5% of the DRV (rounded to the nearest whole percent). We also note that elsewhere on the Supplement Facts label indicates that protein per 2 Tablespoons is 12% with no clear indication as to what the percentage relates.
b) Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label displays the following claim “Canary seed … It contains as much protein as meat …” In the context of this label, FDA considers this claim about canary seed, an ingredient in the food, to be an implied claim about the food itself. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.65(c)(2), the phrases “contains the same amount of [nutrient] as a [food]” and “as much [nutrient] as a [food]” may be used on the label or in the labeling of foods, provided that the amount of the nutrient in the reference food is enough to qualify that food as a “good source” of that nutrient, and the labeled food, on a per serving basis, is an equivalent, good source of that nutrient (e.g., “as much fiber as an apple,” “Contains the same amount of Vitamin C as an 8 oz. glass of orange juice.”). Under 21 CFR 101.54(c), the term “good source” may be used to characterize the level of a nutrient on the label and in the labeling of foods provided that the food contains 10 to 19 percent of the RDI or the DRV per RACC. As stated previously, the Supplement Facts label declares 2.6 g of protein per 2 Tablespoons of the product, which is only 5% of the DRV for protein; 5% protein is not within 10 to 19% of the DRV for protein and, therefore, your product does not qualify to be “an equivalent, good source.”
3. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutritional information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a) The product label declares “Proprietary Blend … 610g”, that being the total net contents of the product. The use of “Proprietary Blend” with its quantitative amount is permitted in the Supplement Facts label but relative to the serving size. Furthermore, any “Proprietary Blend” declaration with its quantitative amount must be in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iii)(c).
b) The label fails to declare dietary ingredients by the correct name and in the correct order and format, per 21 CFR 101.36.
c) The declaration of calories is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2) and 101.9(c)(1) in that the caloric content per serving is not expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories. Furthermore, the declaration does not appear to correlate with the declared quantitative amounts for the listed macronutrients.
d) The label fails to declare the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient either in a separate column aligned to the right of the column of names or immediately following the listing of names within the same column. When information on the percent of Daily Values is listed, this information must be presented in one column aligned under the heading of ""% Daily Value"" and to the right of the column of amounts. The headings ""% Daily Value (DV),"" ""% DV,"" ""Percent Daily Value,"" or ""Percent DV"" may be substituted for ""% Daily Value."" The heading ""% Daily Value"" must be placed on the same line as the heading ""Amount Per Serving."" [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(A)]
e) Each quantitative amount declared for the carbohydrates, protein, and fat fail to use the level of significance given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B).
f) The label fails to include a heavy bar under “Servings per Container, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6).
g) The label fails to list (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in the correct order, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
h) The title and all headings are not bolded to distinguish them from the other information, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).
i) The label declares 0% for Vitamin A, Vitamin D, Vitamin B12, and cholesterol. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
j) The declared % Daily Values for protein and carbohydrate do not correlate with the quantitative amounts declared for each macronutrient.
k) The label declares “*Percent of daily value are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. Your daily value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs. Daily value has not been established.” There is no provision in the regulation for the “Your daily value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs.” in the Supplement Facts label. Other dietary ingredients (also known as (b)(3)-dietary ingredients) must bear a symbol (different than the symbol used for the 2,000 calorie diet statement) under the heading of the % Daily Value that refers to the same symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement “Daily Value not established.”
4. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because the product label contains information in two languages but does not repeat all of the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language. The product includes foreign language on the label but fails to declare the product name, all information in the Supplements Facts label, and the name and address of the responsible party in both languages.
5. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incomplete. Specifically, the product’s label fails to declare the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams) following the common household measure, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7).
6. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
7. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the label fails to declare the common or usual name of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4(a) and (h). For example, the product’s batch product record indicates “canary seed (Phalaris canariensis).” The standardized common name forPhalaris canariensisis “canary grass”, as noted in Herbs of Commerce. Furthermore, the Supplement Facts label lists “guanabana” which is not a standardized common name listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce; soursop is the standardized common name for guanabana.” In addition, the batch record indicates “guanabana leaf powder”.
8. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the labeling makes structure/function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b) and (c). Under section 403(r)(6) of the Act, a dietary supplement may bear certain claims, generally called ""structure/function claims,"" on its label or in its labeling provided that the firm has substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading; the firm has notified FDA within 30 days of marketing the product bearing the claim; and the claim includes the mandatory disclaimer.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label’s dietary supplement statement of identity is not presented in bold type on the principal display panel and in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the principal display panel. (see 21 CFR 101.3(d))
2. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label is not based upon the revised nutrition labeling regulation which became effective July 26, 2016. Labels were to comply with the revised labeling regulation by January 1, 2020, or January 1, 2021, depending upon the annual food sales of the manufacturer. When making revisions to your product label, you must comply with the current regulations. (see 21 CFR 101.9, 101.30, and 101.36)
3. Your “Yerbas Finas Leche de Alpiste con Guanabana y Omega-3” product label declares Vitamin C at a level of 214% Daily Value (DV) per serving; however, a review of the batch production record, packing slip and certificate of analysis for this product does not appear to indicate that the product contains ingredient(s) that would provide Vitamin C at a level of 214% DV per serving.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Sabrina Cosmetics d/b/a SCOS:
The Center for Tobacco Products of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently reviewed the website https://sabrinacosmeticss.info and determined that electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) products listed there are offered for sale or distribution to customers in the United States.
Under section 201(rr) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)), these products are tobacco products because they are made or derived from tobacco or contain nicotine from any source and are intended for human consumption. Certain tobacco products, including ENDS products, are subject to FDA jurisdiction under section 901(b) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387a(b)) and 21 C.F.R. § 1100.1, and are required to be in compliance with the requirements in the FD&C Act.
Please be aware that, on March 15, 2022, the President signed legislation to amend the FD&C Act to extend FDA’s jurisdiction to products “containing nicotine from any source,” not just nicotine derived from tobacco. See Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Public Law 117-103, Division P, Title I, Subtitle B. Specifically, this legislation expanded the definition of “tobacco product” under section 201(rr) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)) to include products containing nicotine from any source. As of April 14, 2022, it is illegal for a retailer to sell any tobacco product, containing nicotine from any source – including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, cigars, and e-cigarettes – to anyone under 21.
Tobacco Product Sold to an Individual Under the Age of 21 is Misbranded
FDA has determined that your Mixed Berry Bundle product containing a PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)) because this product was sold to a person younger than 21 years of age.
FDA’s investigation of the website https://sabrinacosmeticss.info revealed that you sold an ENDS product to an individual under the age of 21. Specifically, during our investigation of https://sabrinacosmeticss.info, a person younger than 21 years of age purchased your Mixed Berry Bundle product containing a PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product from your website. No retailer may sell tobacco products to a person younger than 21 years of age under section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)). Under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)), tobacco products are misbranded if sold or distributed in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)).
Because this tobacco product is sold or distributed to persons younger than 21 years of age in violation of section 906(d)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387f(d)(5)), this product is misbranded under section 903(a)(7)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 387c(a)(7)(B)).
Marketing Tobacco Products in Combination with Any Other FDA Regulated Product Violation
Additionally, FDA has determined that your Mixed Berry Bundle product containing a PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product violates section 201(rr)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)(4)) because it is marketed in combination with cosmetic products.
FDA’s investigation of the website https://sabrinacosmeticss.info revealed that it markets and co-packages for sale PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS product in combination with cosmetic products. Under section 201(rr)(4) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(rr)(4)), a tobacco product shall not be marketed in combination with any other article or product regulated under the FD&C Act, including a drug, biologic, food, cosmetic, medical device, or dietary supplement. You marketed and co-packaged for sale PUFF Plus Mixed Berries Disposable ENDS in combination with Max Makeup Cherimoya Lip Polish, Broadway Argan Oil Lip Gloss, and false eyelashes cosmetic products that are regulated under the FD&C Act. Accordingly, you violated the prohibition in section 201(rr)(4) of the FD&C Act.
Conclusion and Requested Actions
It is your responsibility to ensure that your tobacco products and all related labeling and/or advertising on this website, on any other websites (including e-commerce, social networking, or search engine websites), in any other media in which you advertise, and in any retail establishments comply with each applicable provision of the FD&C Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. Failure to address any violations of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and FDA’s implementing regulations, including those in 21 C.F.R. Parts 1140, 1141, and 1143, may lead to regulatory action, including, but not limited to, civil money penalties, seizure, and/or injunction. Please note that tobacco products offered for import into the United States that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission.
Please be aware that the FD&C Act requires “new tobacco products” to have premarket authorization. A “new tobacco product” is any tobacco product that was not commercially marketed in the United States as of February 15, 2007, or any modified tobacco product that was commercially marketed after February 15, 2007. See Section 910(a) of the FD&C Act. Retailers should discuss with their suppliers the current marketing status of any particular tobacco product’s application or any product’s marketing authorization.
The violations discussed in this letter do not necessarily constitute an exhaustive list. You should address any violations that are referenced above, as well as violations that are the same as or similar to those stated above, and promptly take any necessary actions to bring your tobacco products into compliance with the FD&C Act.
Please submit a written response to this letter within 15 working days from the date of receipt describing your actions to address any violations and bring your products into compliance, including the dates on which you discontinued the violative labeling, advertising, sale, and/or distribution of these tobacco products and your plan for maintaining compliance with the FD&C Act. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you with an opportunity to address them. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s homepage athttp://www.fda.gov.

PO Box 281Palisades Park, NJ 07650
RE: 646494
Dear Mr. Lee:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.adamssecret.com, in May 2022 and again in December 2022, where you take orders for “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 3000 Platinum,” “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Blue,” “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Purple,” “Adam's Secret Extra Strength Amazing Black,” “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 2000,” (hereinafter referred to as your “Adam’s Secret” products) and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense.” We also reviewed your social media websites at www.instagram.com/adamssecretus and www.facebook.com/AdamsSecretUSA, where you direct consumers to your website, www.adamssecret.com, to purchase your products. In addition, FDA has obtained samples and labeling of your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that samples of your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Slim Sense” products contain undeclared pharmaceutical ingredients.1Specifically, samples of your “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 3000 Platinum,” “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Blue,” and “Adam's Secret Extra Strength Amazing Black,” products contain tadalafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. In addition, samples of your “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength Purple” and “Adam’s Secret Extra Strength 2000” products contain tadalafil and sildenafil. Tadalafil is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor and the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Cialis used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). Sildenafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor and the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra also used to treat ED. These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates. Additionally, FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” product contains lorcaserin, a controlled substance and the active ingredient in the withdrawn prescription drug Belviq, formerly used for chronic weight management in some overweight or obese adults. Lorcaserin may cause psychiatric disturbances and impairments in attention or memory. Further, this hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events. Belviq was withdrawn from the market on September 2020 after FDA requested that the manufacturer voluntarily withdraw the drug because of a safety clinical trial that showed an increased occurrence of cancer.
Information on the labels and/or labeling of your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products demonstrate that they are marketed as dietary supplements. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003, and approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that tadalafil and sildenafil were not marketed as dietary supplements or as food before Cialis and Viagra were approved, your Adam’s Secret products are excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Similarly, “Dr. Reade Slim Sense,” which contains lorcaserin, is also excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement. According to section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(3)(B)(ii), the definition of a dietary supplement does not include an article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its authorization for investigation as a new drug. Lorcaserin has been authorized for investigation as a new drug under an investigational new drug (IND) application. When Belviq was approved for marketing as a new drug in the United States, the existence of substantial completed clinical investigations of lorcaserin became public. Based on the information available to FDA, lorcaserin was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before it was authorized for investigation as a new drug. Therefore, “Dr. Reade Slim Sense,” which contains lorcaserin, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(3)(B)(ii).

Examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:

An image of the product’s label on your website states: “Clinically proven fat burner for healthy and safe weight loss.”
Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, they are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for your Adam’s Secret or “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products. Introduction or delivery for introduction of these product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fail to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Your Adam’s Secret products, which contain undeclared sildenafil and/or tadalafil, and your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” product, which contains undeclared lorcaserin, are prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), in light of their toxicity or potential for harmful effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for their use. Prescription drugs can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs, including your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products. Your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are not exempt from the requirements that their labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA approved application in effect for these products. For these reasons, your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
Additionally, your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products do not declare that the products contain a PDE-5 inhibitor or lorcacerin. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in your Adam’s Secret products may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The presence of undeclared lorcaserin in your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” product may cause psychiatric disturbances and impairments in attention or memory. Further, this hidden drug ingredient may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events. The failure to disclose these ingredients in the products’ labeling renders your Adam’s Secret and “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients in your products also cause these products to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because their labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors and/or lorcaserin. Consumers who use your Adam’s Secret and/or your “Dr. Reade Slim Sense” products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drug products is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

RE: 643724
Dear Mr. Flores:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located in Doral, FL, on June 2-3, 7, 10, and 14, 2022. FDA obtained a sample and labeling of your product “SANGTER Natural Male Energy Supplement” (hereinafter “SANGTER Energy Supplement”) during the inspection. We also reviewed your firm’s website at www.sangter.com.
Based on the inspection and review of your product labeling, including your firm’s website, FDA determined that “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, the product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352, and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your product, “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), sildenafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Sildenafil is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Viagra, an FDA-approved prescription drug used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED).1
Information on the labels and/or labeling of “SANGTER Energy Supplement” demonstrates that the sampled product is marketed as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Prior to that date, sildenafil had not been marketed as a food or dietary supplement. Given that sildenafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Viagra was approved, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i).
Unapproved New Drug
“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1) because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website homepage, www.sangter.com, that establish the intended use of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
• “100% Natural Male Performance Booster”• “Damiana (turnera diffusa) It is a plant known for its aphrodisiac qualities that help stimulate the sexual appetite or libido”• “In just 30 minutes or less after consumption you will feel its effect, more energy, more sexual desire and more power.”• “Its main use applies to erectile dysfunction and low sexual desire, but it is also used against general weakness, painfulness, spontaneous sweat.”
“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore, is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, a new drug may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There is no FDA-approved application in effect for “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drug
“SANGTER Energy Supplement” is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that the labeling fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 C.F.R. 201.5. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Prescription drugs can only be used safely at the direction and under the supervision of a licensed practitioner. “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” which contains undeclared sildenafil, is also a prescription drug as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A), in light of its toxicity or potential for harmful effects, methods of use, or collateral measures necessary for its use. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs, including “SANGTER Energy Supplement.” “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because there is no FDA-approved application in effect for this product. For these reasons, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
Additionally, “SANGTER Energy Supplement” is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “SANGTER Energy Supplement” does not declare that the product contains a PDE-5 inhibitor. The use of PDE-5 inhibitors can be associated with significant safety issues and the risk of serious adverse events. The undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors in “SANGTER Energy Supplement” may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take the products without knowing that they can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease often take nitrates. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the product’s labeling renders “SANGTER Energy Supplement” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The undeclared sildenafil in “SANGTER Energy Supplement” also causes the product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because the labeling lacks adequate warning for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is a potential for serious health risks associated with this product, particularly since anyone who takes these products would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredient and placed at risk for the associated adverse events.The introduction, delivery for introduction, or causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA acknowledges that on August 1, 2022, you initiated a voluntary nationwide recall of Lot #48656, Exp. 01/2025 of “SANGTER Energy Supplement,” 3000 mg, packaged in 7-count blister packs within a carton to the consumer level. We also acknowledge that you notified your customers of the recall by press release on August 2, 2022.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.

WARNING LETTER
WL 638942
Dear Ms. Jollay:
The U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your juice manufacturing facility, located at 2335 Del Monte Street, West Sacramento, CA 95691 on June 9, 10, 22, 24, and 29, 2022. We found that you have serious violations of the FDA’s juice Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 120 (21 CFR Part 120). In accordance with 21 CFR 120.9, failure of a processor to have and implement a HACCP plan that complies with the requirements of 21 CFR Part 120 renders the juice products adulterated within the meaning of Section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)]. Accordingly, your juice products are adulterated in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. You may find the Act, FDA’s juice HACCP regulations and the Juice HACCP Hazards and Controls Guidance through links in FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
To date, the agency has not received a written response from your firm regarding the violations noted on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm at the conclusion of the inspection.
The significant violations include the following:
1. You did not validate that your HACCP plan is adequate to control food hazards when a change in the process occurred that could have affected the hazard analysis or altered the HACCP plan in any way, as required by 21 CFR 120.11(b).You were informed on June 1, 2022, that organic fresh strawberries (from “(b)(4)”) that you received were potentially contaminated with hepatitis A. You used these strawberries in the juice products(b)(4)and(b)(4)manufactured on(b)(4).
During the inspection at your facility on June 9, 2022, you stated that after being notified of the potentially contaminated strawberries, you reviewed your production records to verify the implicated strawberries received were used only in the(b)(4)and(b)(4)juices. You also notified your processor who applies high pressure processing (HPP) as a treatment to produce the required minimum 5-log reduction, and you notified the produce supplier of the use of these strawberries in the(b)(4)products.
Your Hazard Analysis and HACCP plan for “Cold Pressed Beverages,” dated September 30, 2021, did not identify hepatitis A as a hazard. In addition, your customer’s HPP process validation study that covers the juice products does not cover hepatitis A. However, you did not validate your HACCP plan before manufacturing subsequent lots of(b)(4)and(b)(4)on(b)(4). For example:
You did not evaluate/reassess the applicable HPP validation studies and critical limits after being notified, to determine if they were adequate to control for hepatitis A.
You did not evaluate/reassess the effectiveness of your sanitation procedures to address the potential for cross contamination to other products. Your sanitation procedures for processing equipment such as the(b)(4)and batch tanks only included a(b)(4)rinse between pressing different fruits and vegetables and between processing different juices.
You did not reassess your strawberry supplier to determine if you should discontinue use or implement additional measures at receiving. You received additional shipments containing strawberries from the same supplier on June 6, 2022 and June 27, 2022.
2. Your written hazard analysis does not consist of an identification of food hazards and an identification of the control measures that can be applied, as required by 21 CFR 120.7(a).
a) Your hazard analysis for “Cold Pressed Beverages,” dated September 30, 2021, identifies “Vegetative pathogens (Listeria, Salmonella, E. coli)” as potential hazards but does not identify any control measures to produce the required minimum 5-log reduction in the pertinent microorganism(s) in any of the juices and juice-based beverages that it covers.b) You use fresh apples and frozen unpasteurized not from concentrate (NFC) apple juice in several of your blended juices/juice products. You have not identified Cryptosporidium parvum as a food hazard in your hazard analysis for your apple juice products. Also, you have not identified any controls for the hazard. Furthermore, the associated HPP validation study which was used to establish the critical limits for HPP processing only considered Listeria, E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp. You manufactured “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)?” juice product using fresh apples on(b)(4).
3. You must monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, at a minimum, conformance with the current good manufacturing practice requirements in 21 CFR 117, Subpart B (CGMPs), that are both appropriate to your plant and the food being processed and relate to one of the areas specified in 21 CFR 120.6(a)(1)-(8), to comply with 21 CFR 120.6(b).
However, on June 9, 2022 you failed to monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure, at a minimum, conformance with CGMPs in the following areas:
A. You failed to monitor handwashing with sufficient frequency to ensure that hands are washed thoroughly at any time when the hands may have become soiled or contaminated, as required by 21 CFR 117.10(b)(3). This is related to prevention of cross contamination from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3).
i. The employee who was setting up/assembling the(b)(4)did not change gloves or wash hands prior to loading the conveyor at the(b)(4)with celery stalks for the product, “(b)(4).”ii. The production manager did not wash his hands prior to donning gloves to enter production area to set up/stage bottles for the filler line. He put the disposable gloves over the cloth gloves he was wearing. He then grabbed these bottles to load the conveyor from the mouth of the bottle where his gloved fingers were touching the inside of the bottle.
B. You failed to monitor the conditions and practices during processing with sufficient frequency to ensure that building, fixtures, and other physical facilities of the plant are maintained in a clean and sanitary condition as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). This is related to prevention of cross contamination from insanitary objects to food, 21 CFR 120.6(a)(3).
i. An employee at the blending station used the employee hand washing station by the blending station to rinse a small bowl and a whisk used for mixing(b)(4)used in the products, “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4).”ii. A small plastic trash can for employees to dispose of gloves and paper towels at the hand washing station near the blending station was overfilled with trash. Strawberries were observed all over the floor around the trash can and red spots identified as liquid from discarded frozen strawberries were observed on the gloves located at the handwashing station. These gloves are for employee use during production.iii. There was an open ceiling tile above the filler line where uncapped bottles were being conveyed to a carousel table.iv. There was heavy dust build-up on power cords hanging off the ceiling above the open(b)(4)and the open(b)(4)that were in use.v. There was a rusty pipe located directly above the(b)(4).
4. You did not maintain sanitation standard operating procedure (SSOP) records that document the monitoring and corrections of conditions and practices during processing, as required per 21 CFR 120.6(c).
a) Your “Food Allergen Control” SOP BQP-03-D, states under the Sanitation section as follows: “(b)(4).”
The production records for April 28, 2022 show you used staging tank(b)(4)and the filler line to fill bottles of “(b)(4)” product, which contains coconut water. The record shows that the following products that do not contain coconut were filled on the filler line after “(b)(4)at(b)(4)at(b)(4)at(b)(4)at(b)(4). The “FILLER START-UP/CHANGEOVER CHECKLIST” used for monitoring the filler includes a box to be checked to “Verify Filler is Cleaned.” The form does not include fields to document the criteria (e.g., chemical concentration, temperature and time for treatments) required per your “Food Allergen Control” procedure. You stated you do not keep other records for monitoring the sanitation process between product changeovers.
Furthermore, you stated you conduct a verification step by collecting swabs to test for coconut allergen after cleaning and sanitation and prior to producing the next product without the coconut allergen. However, your “ALLERGEN TESTING LOCATIONS” record dated April 28, 2022, shows that swabbing was completed at(b)(4). This time does not correspond with the production records that indicate at(b)(4)your firm had already started filling the next product, “(b)(4).”
b) You do not maintain SSOP monitoring records for employee health conditions that could result in the microbial contamination of food.
Additional Comments:
You use(b)(4)in your “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” juice products. You identified the ingredient as a spice in your “Cold Pressed Beverages HACCP Plan.” In evaluating which food hazards are reasonably likely to occur, you did not consider the unapproved use of food or color additives as required per 21 CFR 120.7(c). There is no regulation in 21 Code of Federal Regulation that permits the use of(b)(4)as a direct food additive or color additive, and we are not aware of a basis to conclude its use as an ingredient in food would be generally recognized as safe by qualified experts. Activated carbon is allowed for use in the manufacture of closure-sealing gaskets for food containers per 21 CFR 177.1210; however, this is not applicable to your products as the(b)(4)is directly added as an ingredient. Further, you have not assessed(b)(4)for safety. Your ingredient supplier’s(b)(4)product label states, “Do not consume at the same time as any medicines or other dietary supplement, as this may interfere with their effectiveness.” FDA has evaluated the use of(b)(4)as an emetic poison treatment drug. Our review found that while it may be used in high doses, it can adsorb other nutrients or medications; therefore, it can interfere with the consumer’s medications or dietary needs. Additionally,(b)(4)can contain carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbons and unsafe levels of heavy metals. Little is known about the safety of chronic consumption of(b)(4).
If your use of(b)(4)imparts color to these beverages, it meets the statutory definition of a color additive at section 201(t) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(t)]. Color additives are deemed unsafe unless their use conforms with a regulation listing the color additive and describing the conditions for its safe use (section 721(a) of the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 379e(a)]. There is no regulation authorizing use of(b)(4)as a color additive in food. Food that contains an unapproved color additive is deemed adulterated (section 402(c) of the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(c)].
The violations in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of the violations that may exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

United States
Dear Michael A. Witynski:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, Family Dollar Distribution Inc., located at 1800 Family Dollar Parkway, West Memphis, AR 72301 from January 11, 2022 through February 11, 2022. Your facility holds and distributes various human foods, including dietary supplements; animal foods; cosmetics; over-the-counter drugs (OTC drugs); and devices. Based on the inspectional findings, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations.
Under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a), the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adulterated is a prohibited act. Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(k)] to do any act with respect to a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, if such act is done while the products are held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the products being adulterated.  You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We acknowledge your firm initiated a voluntary recall of certain products regulated by the FDA that were stored and shipped to 404 stores from Family Dollar Distribution Inc.,  in West Memphis, Arkansas from January 1, 2021 through March 18, 2022 due to the presence of rodents and rodent activity at the Family Dollar Distribution Center. At the close of the inspection, you were issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, dated February 11, 2022. FDA received your written responses to those observations on March 7; March 22; April 8; May 6; June 10; July 15; August 19; and September 30, 2022. In your May 6, 2022, letter, you state that you are permanently closing the facility. We have reviewed your responses and we discuss your significant violations and your corrective actions below.
Adulterated Human Foods and Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Foods under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117). These violations cause your human food and dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(3)] in that your products consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if it is otherwise unfit for food and section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.
1. You did not take effective measures to exclude pests from your holding areas and to protect against contamination of food on the premises by pests as required by 21 CFR 117.35(c). Specifically, our investigators observed evidence of rodent activity, including live rodents, dead rodents in various states of decay, rodent excreta pellets (REPs) in numbers too numerous to count (TNTC), gnaw marks in food and food packaging, nesting material, and odors indicative of rodent infestation throughout the entire facility including areas where human food, including dietary supplements, are routinely stored. Below are some examples of the observations made by the investigators:
• Four rat carcasses on the conveyer belt along the south wall of your facility by aisles(b)(4)and(b)(4)
• Significant gnawings, REPs TNTC, and a strong odor of rodent urine and excreta on a pallet containing(b)(4)cases of mixed nuts stored in rack location(b)(4). Multiple bags of product were gnawed open, and product was spilling out of cases onto lower levels of the pallet. Gnawings and spilled product could be seen from the top(b)(4)layer down to the 3rd layer of the pallet.
• REP and(b)(7)(E)hair on top of a pallet of Vitamin C 1000 mg dietary supplements.
• Approximately 15 REPs on a pallet of flour located in rack location(b)(4). Eleven of the(b)(4)cases stored on the pallet contained product with gnawings. While investigators unstacked the pallet, two mice exited from gnawed-open product bags stacked on the bottom layer of the pallet and ran west under the north end of aisle(b)(4).
• Approximately 30 REPs in and around a pallet containing(b)(4)cardboard cases with twelve 5.6-ounce pouches of Chicken Flavor Rice & Pasta Blend product stored in rack location(b)(4). This pallet also had nesting material and tunnelling in between the bottom layers 1 and 2 of the pallet and at the top ((b)(4)) layer. Approximately 20 of the cases on the pallet contained significant rodent gnawings.
• Four rats crossing aisle(b)(4)from east to west near the south side of the aisle and two more rats crossing aisle(b)(4)from west to east near the south side of the aisle. Food is stored along the entirety of the floor levels of aisles(b)(4).
• At least 5 rats were noted in rack location(b)(4), which is in the northeast corner of one of the two food storage areas in your facility. Rats were climbing through the pallet in this rack location and climbing up rack scaffolding to reach upper levels.
• A strong foul odor/stench of dead and decaying rodents, rodent pellets, and evidence of rodents nesting in and around the Inventory Control Center (ICC) and the breakroom, which is located directly north of food aisles(b)(4). According to firm management, the General Manager closed the ICC and breakroom in October 2021 because of complaints related to strong odors associated with dead rodents. Inspectors observed that the ICC was cleared out and closed off, and a putrid odor continued to permeate the room. The breakroom above the ICC was closed and rodent nesting materials were in front of the entrance.
• Apparent bird droppings were observed on chocolate protein shakes and Vitamin C supplement drops and on the floor near the northeast side of the small food storage racks by the shipping area ((b)(4)and(b)(4), respectively).
• Two dead birds were observed within the facility. One bird was caught in netting hung from the roof above pallets of breakfast cereals. The second was observed on the east side of the mezzanine level under part of the old conveyor system.
In addition to visual observations, FDA documented the following findings:
• FDA collected several samples during the inspection. These samples included human food products (samples 1124522, 1179824, and 1179931) and an animal food product (sample 1176277), product packaging, and a filth sample (sample 1176276). These samples were submitted to FDA labs for analysis. FDA’s analysis found the presence of urine, gnaw marks in the packaging, rodent hairs, and/or REPs in these samples. Further, the filth sample included REPs and nesting materials collected from all four corners and the center of the warehouse (including the center of each of the two food areas), demonstrating the rodent population was throughout the facility.
• FDA conducted a review of your pest control records. Reports from your pest control company documented the capture of between 16 and 107 rodents for all months of 2020 and January – June of 2021. In addition, your maintenance team conducted additional monitoring and tracking of rodent captures made in large bait boxes and glue traps placed by your pest control company along the pick-slot level of aisles(b)(4). Between the dates of March 29, 2021 to September 17, 2021, your firm documented over 2300 rodent captures. Following a facility fumigation between January 16 - January 20, 2022, approximately 1100 rodent carcasses were “harvested” or removed from your facility by firm employees and your pest control company.
• According to internal emails reviewed during the inspection, your firm was contacted by stores as far back as December 8, 2020, sharing their observations of rodent activity in deliveries of food products from the distribution center. Specifically, throughout 2021, retail stores serviced by the West Memphis distribution center emailed complaints of receiving food products gnawed by rodents, nesting materials inside of packages, and case containing both live and dead rodents from the distribution center.
2. You did not maintain buildings, fixtures, and other physical facilities of your plant in a clean and sanitary condition and in repair adequate to prevent food from becoming adulterated as required by 21 CFR 117.35(a). Specifically, insanitary conditions were observed throughout your facility demonstrating that sanitation and cleaning operations were not conducted in a manner that protects against contamination of food. These insanitary conditions provided food sources and pest harborage areas for rodents and other pests. In addition, inadequate maintenance to parts of the facility allowed for potential pest entry and harborage areas within the facility. The following are examples of insanitary conditions that were observed:
• Investigators observed spilled breakfast cereal, spilled Chicken Flavor Rice & Pasta Blend product, spilled all-purpose flour, spilled popcorn, and spilled sunflower seeds. All products had REPs mixed in with spilled product. Fluorescing stains were observed in and around the packaging for spilled flour and popcorn.
• Accumulations of trash and debris in multiple locations, including the old conveyor system located in the mezzanine level and in the “Junk Yard” portion of the warehouse, which contains maintenance equipment.
• Open packages of baby wipes were observed in the warehouse with fluorescent stains indicative of urea or urine.
• Following the fumigation of the facility, the inadequate sanitation practices became more apparent as dead pests were observed in various states of decay throughout the facility. These observations included, but are not limited to:
o Multiple dead rodents found near slots(b)(4)and #(b)(4).
o Dead rodents along the north wall, near the ICC and breakroom, on March 7, 2022. One was caught in a snap trap zip tied to a metal beam next to dock door(b)(4)and the other was behind a metal beam against the outer wall.
o A dead bird below part of the old conveyor system on March 7, 2022.
The following are examples of inadequate maintenance conditions that were observed:
• Gaps were found along the top of the compactor that is meant to create a seal between the compactor and the exterior wall of the facility. Additionally, holes were observed in the compactor sidewall ranging from an estimated 1 inch to 12 inches on both the north and south facing sides allowing for potential pest entry. The compactor has a(b)(4)door for access from the inside of the firm that is left open during business hours. While this door is open, the gaps and holes present the potential for pest entry into the facility.
• Multiple dock doors were observed to have gaps allowing for potential entry of pests into the facility. More specifically, receiving doors(b)(4)and(b)(4)had gaps up to 3 inches in length and 1 inch in height around the doors, and receiving doors(b)(4),(b)(4)and(b)(4)were observed to have gaps at least 2 inches in height and 6 inches in length. Shipping doors(b)(4)and(b)(4)were observed to have approximately 2-inch gaps running the entirety of each side of the dock plates.
• Your firm began the decommissioning of a conveyor system. Parts of the decommissioned system were left in the mezzanine level where cobwebs, dirt, dust, and debris has built up under and around these parts. This equipment became a harborage area for rodents as evidenced by the observation of a dead rodent that was seen in between the conveyor belts of the “Upper West Side Belt” and investigators noting a foul odor indicative of dead and decaying animals in another section of what would be the “Upper Southside Belt.”
3. You did not keep grounds around your plant in a condition that would protect against the contamination of food as required by 21 CFR 117.20(a). Specifically, you did not properly store equipment, remove litter and waste, and cut weeds or grass within the immediate vicinity of the plant that may constitute an attractant, breeding place, or harborage for pests, as required by 21 CFR 117.20(a)(1). For example, throughout the inspection, FDA investigators observed the following conditions:
• Large amounts of trash (including food trash), wood from pallets, and debris were piled below dock doors and along the shipping and receiving area walls of the facility.
• Piled-up trash extending approximately 2 feet out from the walls of the facility.
• Large amounts of food trash and dirt piled below and surrounding the compacter that appeared to have spilled from a breach in the side panel of the compactor.
• Throughout the inspection, piles of food next to or spilling out of the large open-top dumpsters located on the west side of the shipping dock.
Adulterated Cosmetics
4. The cosmetic products that you hold and distribute are adulterated within the meaning of section 601(c) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 361(c)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health. Specifically, during the January 11, 2022 to February 11, 2022 inspection of your West Memphis, Arkansas facility, our investigators observed insanitary conditions that may cause your cosmetic products to be contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health. Specifically, there was apparent filth and evidence of rodent activity throughout the warehouse, and the equipment and facility are not maintained to prevent the contamination of the cosmetic products. For example, our investigators observed the following:
• Rodent excreta pellets on and around cosmetic products stored in your facility.
• Multiple dock doors and dock plates in both shipping and receiving areas with gaps ranging in size exposing the facility to the environment.
• Multiple holes in rubber sealants and gaps surrounding pipes and wiring exiting the building.
• Heavy buildup of dust and debris around and under pallets storing cosmetic products.
Adulterated Animal Foods
The inspection of your facility revealed evidence of significant violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Food for Animals under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 507 (21 CFR 507). These violations cause your animal food products to be adulterated under section 402(a)(3) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(3)] in that your products consist in whole or in part of any filthy, putrid, or decomposed substance, or if they are otherwise unfit for food and under section 402(a)(4) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have become contaminated with filth, or whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.
5. Your firm failed to hold animal food for distribution under conditions that protect against contamination and minimize deterioration in accordance with 21 CFR 507.27(a). Specifically, during the inspection, investigators documented insanitary conditions in the area of your warehouse where bagged pet foods are stored. The insanitary conditions observed by our investigators include significant rodent activity, such as gnaw holes in packaging material, rodent excreta pellets, nesting materials, urine stains, live rodents, and rodent carcasses. These conditions were observed in the center of each of the(b)(4)food areas of your warehouse, consisting of aisles(b)(4)and(b)(4). These conditions were also observed in all four corners and the center of the warehouse.
6. Your firm failed to take effective measures to exclude pests and protect animal foods from contamination by pests as required by 21 CFR 507.19(e). Specifically, your firm’s failures at preventing, controlling, and mitigating an active rodent infestation were described under the human foods observations 1-2 above. The animal foods stored and distributed at your warehouse were under the same conditions and exposed to the same insanitary conditions as the human food products. The extent of the rodent activity in the facility was documented through the collection of a filth sample (1176276) which included REPs and nesting material from all four corners of the warehouse that confirmed the presence of rodents throughout the warehouse. Additional observations or findings by FDA Investigators of rodent activity in and around animal food products include the following:
• Rodent gnawings on seven out of(b)(4)bags of High Protein Chicken & Turkey Flavored dog food stored on a pallet in rack location(b)(4)on the southwest corner of food area(b)(4)This pallet also contained TNTC apparent REPs on and around the bags of dog food.
• Approximately 40 REPs on a pallet containing(b)(4)bundles of four 3.15-pound bags of Tender & Crunchy Combo cat food stored in rack location(b)(4)One of the 3.15-pound bags also contained a circular gnaw-hole approximately 1.5 inches in diameter.
• TNTC REPs on and around a pallet containing(b)(4)16-pound bags of Gravy Style Beef Flavored dog food held in rack location(b)(4)
• TNTC REPs on a pallet containing(b)(4)twelve-pound bags of Surfin’ & Turfin’ Favorites dry cat food stored in rack location(b)(4). Three bags on the lowest layer of the pallet also contained gnaw holes ranging from 2 inches to 4 inches in diameter. FDA sample 1176277 of Surfin’ & Turfin animal food, collected on January 13, 2022, included the product, its packaging, and REPs was submitted for analysis. The FDA lab determined that the submitted product had urine stains and rodent hairs, the packaging had rodent gnawings and urine stains, and the REPs were determined to be of rodent origin.
In addition to the rodent infestation, investigators documented the presence of birds in and around the animal foods. Specifically, on February 1, 2022, apparent bird droppings covering an area of flooring 1.5 foot wide, and 3 feet long were observed by the northwest end of aisle(b)(4). On February 9, 2022, investigators observed new bird droppings covering the same area. Aisle(b)(4)is primarily used for storage of pallets containing large bags of animal food. In addition to the bird droppings, a dead bird was observed caught in bird netting overtop of this area.
Adulterated Human Drugs
During our January 11 to February 11, 2022 inspection of your facility investigators from the FDA determined that your firm holds and distributes OTC drug products that are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)] in that the building used in the holding of drug products was not maintained in a clean and sanitary condition and was infested by rodents and other vermin as required by 21 CFR 211.56(a). The drug products held at your facility were also adulterated under 501(a)(2)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C, 351(a)(2)(A)] in that the drug products were prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health.
7. During the inspection, our investigator observed filthy conditions in your facility. We observed significant rodent activity throughout the facility. We observed dead rodents and birds in various areas inside your facility, rodent urine and feces in and on several pallets containing drug products, and pungent odors in various areas inside your facility. As you are aware, rodents are disease vectors and goods contaminated with rodent feces and/or urine may causeSalmonellaand other infectious diseases. Infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, and immunocompromised persons are at greatest risk for infection and are more likely to have severe symptoms. Consumers can become infected by handling contaminated drugs, including packaging, and then transferring the bacteria from their hands to their mouth. Additionally,Salmonellaon hands or clothes can spread the bacteria to other people, objects, and surfaces.
8. Products stored at your facility, including adulterated drug products, were shipped to 404 Family Dollar retail stores after being held in the above-mentioned conditions. You were aware of a rodent infestation at your facility beginning in 2020, and you continued to ship products, including drug products, to stores up until January 13, 2022 when fumigation of the facility occurred.
Adulterated Devices
During the inspection of your distribution center, investigators from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that your firm holds and distributes devices, including but not limited to, tampons, face masks, contact lens solutions, adhesive bandages, and pregnancy tests. Under section 201(h) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(h)], these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body.
The devices are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(2)(A)], because they have been prepared, packed, or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been rendered injurious to health.
9. Specifically, the devices held at your distribution center were exposed to significant rodent infestation and rodent excreta pellets. Investigators documented signs of rodent gnawing, and nesting material associated with long term rodent presence throughout the facility where the devices were held. The conditions described above for foods and drugs reflect the general objectionable conditions of the warehouse under which you also held devices regulated by FDA. Additionally, evidence of rodent contamination directly to devices was observed. For example:
• On February 2, 2022, FDA investigators observed a pallet of Family Wellness Pregnancy Tests, lot W00101202, located in bay(b)(4)with numerous rodent excreta pellets on the top of and in between cases along with nesting material and fluorescing stains.
• On February 1, 2022, FDA investigators observed a case of First Response Pregnancy Tests, expiration date 2022-12-23, located in the repack area with a rodent excreta pellet and apparent rodent hairs on top of the boxes.
We acknowledge that your firm conducted a voluntary recall of FDA-regulated devices warehoused at the West Memphis Distribution Center, RES89685, on February 18, 2022; and is conducting ongoing destruction activities of these products within your control. The FDA requests that you include in subsequent responses any ongoing or future corrective actions your firm is implementing specific to these products. Further, we request your firm provides records demonstrating the effectiveness of your corrective actions taken to reduce the presence of rodents, and other pests, in your distribution warehouse, including records of ongoing rodent control activities, such as capture numbers and their locations in your subsequent responses.
Additional Considerations
Your corporation received a Warning Letter (320-20-071sent to Greenbrier International Inc. doing business as Dollar Tree (FEI 3005269673)) on November 6, 2019, for the receipt and delivery or proffered delivery of adulterated drugs in violation of section 301(c) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 331(c)]. Of particular concern, the Warning Letter detailed FDA evidence that Dollar Tree, parent company of Family Dollar, distributed drugs that were manufactured at a facility where rodent feces were found throughout.2In light of these two separate incidents involving significant rodent infestations in your supply chain, we recommend that Family Dollar take steps to evaluate whether there are additional issues with rodent infestation in your drug supply chain.
Cessation of Preparing, Packing or Holding FDA Regulated Articles for Distribution
We acknowledge your decision to close the facility and cease distribution of all FDA regulated articles from the site. We reviewed your written responses dated March 7; March 22; April 8; May 6; June 10; July 15; August 19; and September 30, 2022 but do not see a need to discuss your responses further in light of your decision to close the facility.
If you plan to resume the preparing, packing or holding of FDA regulated articles for distribution at this facility, we request that you notify the FDA of your plans in writing. Remediating violations of the Act will be necessary if Family Dollar, a successor, or an acquirer resumes operations related to FDA regulated articles at this site. A meeting can be scheduled between you and the FDA to discuss the requirements.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. Your firm should investigate and determine the causes of any violations and take prompt actions to correct any violations and bring the products into compliance. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Dear Steven Haynes:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at www.cedarcreekdistributors.com, www.thriftmasterholdings.com, and https://apelindx.com in November 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various products, which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD).1We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.instagram.com/thriftmasterholdings and www.facebook.com/thriftmasterholdings, which are accessible from your website www.thriftmasterholdings.com, where consumers can purchase your products. The claims on your websites and social media accounts establish that your products, “ApelinDx metered dose inhaler,” “Maia CBD Tincture Inhaler,” “Maia CBD Oil,” “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” “Maia Gummies,” and “CBD Pill” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD products”), are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). In addition, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined that your “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” food products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll). Consumers may confuse these products with traditional foods; therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of CBD.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
We also observed that your website, www.thriftmasterholdings.com, and social media websites make claims that your CBD products may be intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.2As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19. Furthermore, your “ApelinDx metered dose inhaler” and “Maia CBD Tincture Inhaler” products are intended to deliver CBD through oral inhalation. These products are particularly concerning to the agency because the ingredients and potential impurities in oral inhalation sprays may trigger laryngospasm and bronchospasm and may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways. Inhalation products that are intended to act locally in the respiratory system also may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects, such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on a review of your websites and social media websites, your CBD products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your websites and social media websites that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your “About Us” webpage https://cedarcreekdistributors.com/about-us/:
“CBD is FDA approved to treat seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Dravet syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.”
“As of 2020, there are various clinical studies underway hoping to determine CBD’s long-thought potential to assist with a variety of physical and mental health ailments, including pain, mood disorders and respiratory problems.”

Additionally, your website https://apelindx.com hyperlinks to a news report discussing the use of CBD to delay the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. The news report shows an image of a product that states “ApelinDx” on the label and appears to be a metered dose inhaler.
Your CBD products are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your CBD products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) Your CBD products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for these products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products are foods to which CBD has been added.
However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.3There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.4
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Maia Dried Mango Slices,” “Maia Dried Pineapple Chunks,” and “Maia Gummies” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

3CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
4Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

Warning Letter 633394
Dear Mr. Wollenberg:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your candy manufacturing facility, at the above-mentioned address, from March 11, 2022 to April 18, 2022. Your firm manufactures ready-to-eat (RTE) chocolate-covered candies which include nuts, pretzels, creams (variety of flavors), marshmallows, caramels, and peanut/pecan clusters. During the inspection, FDA investigators found serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food regulation (CGMP & PC rule), Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 117 (21 CFR Part 117).
Based on FDA’s inspectional findings, we have determined that the candy products manufactured in your facility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(4)], in that they were prepared, packed or held under insanitary conditions whereby they may have been contaminated with filth or rendered injurious to health. In addition, failure of the owner, operator, or agent in charge of a covered facility to comply with the preventive controls provisions of the CGMP & PC rule (located in Subparts A, C, D, E, F, and G of Part 117) is prohibited by section 301(uu) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(uu)].
Further, we found significant violations of the labeling regulations for foods, 21 CFR Part 101. These violations cause your products described below to be misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343].
You may find the Act and further information about the CGMP & PC rule through links in FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
At the conclusion of the inspection, FDA investigators issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, listing violations found at your firm. To date, we have not received a response from you regarding any corrective actions taken.
Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls (Subpart C):
1. Your hazard analysis did not identify and evaluate known or reasonably foreseeable hazards to determine whether the hazards require a preventive control, as required by 21 CFR 117.130(a)(1). Specifically, you did not identify and evaluate egg and wheat as allergen hazards to determine whether they require a preventive control. Your various hazard analyses covering candy products identify “cross-contamination” of peanut and tree nut allergens as a hazard requiring a preventive control. However, you manufacture various flavors of chocolate-covered cream centers that all contain egg, as well as chocolate-covered pretzels that contain wheat. You also manufacture other products that do not contain egg or wheat on shared equipment such as conveyor belts, which are food contact surfaces, on the same day. Allergen cross-contact could occur in products with different allergen profiles, without appropriate controls. Therefore, allergen cross-contact regarding egg and wheat is a known or reasonably foreseeable hazard. Further, a knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing food in your circumstances would identify egg and wheat allergen cross-contact as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Preventive controls for food allergens include procedures, practices, and processes employed for ensuring protection of food from allergen cross-contact, including during storage, handling, and use.
For example:
a. You did not evaluate the potential for allergen cross-contact when you manufacture different products on the same production line on the same day. You routinely manufacture cream center candies (egg), pretzels (wheat), caramels (neither wheat or egg), and marshmallows (neither wheat nor egg) on the same day without adequate cleaning of shared equipment, such as conveyor belts, in between these products with different allergenic profiles.
According to your production records, you enrobed the following products:•(b)(4), Butter Creams (containing egg) then Chocolate Marshmallows (not containing Egg)•(b)(4), Chocolate Pretzels (containing wheat) then Vanilla Creams (not containing wheat)•(b)(4), Vanilla Creams (containing egg) then Vanilla Caramels (not containing egg)•(b)(4), Raspberry Creams (containing egg) then Chocolate Pretzels (not containing egg)•(b)(4), Chocolate Pretzels (containing wheat) followed by Brownie Creams (not containing wheat)•(b)(4), Chocolate Pretzels (containing wheat) then Chocolate Marshmallows (not containing wheat)•(b)(4), Cherry Creams (containing egg) then Chocolate Pretzels (not containing egg)•(b)(4), Chocolate Pretzels (containing wheat) then Chocolate Marshmallows (not containing wheat)•(b)(4), Lemon Creams (containing egg) then Chocolate Pretzels (not containing egg).
Your enrober supervisor explained that other than vacuuming the cloth belts(b)(4), no additional cleaning takes place for the cloth and white conveyor belts in between any product run in each day’s production on the enrober line.
Furthermore, you have no records showing cleaning was performed daily or between producing non-like allergen products on your enrober line, other than when the enrober is drained(b)(4), which occurred three times between October 26, 2021 and April 6, 2022.
b. You did not evaluate the potential for recirculating enrobing chocolate to become a vehicle for allergen cross-contact. On April 4, 2022, FDA Investigators observed particles of the cream centers (containing egg) break loose and fall into the chocolate bottomer and this chocolate was used to coat the bottom of Caramels (not containing egg) on April 5, 2022.
2. Your allergen controls procedures do not ensure protection of food from allergen cross-contact from walnuts, as required by 21 CFR 117.135(c)(2)(i). Your “Food Safety Plan for Chocolate Enrobing Department (April 2020)” identifies “Cross Contamination of Allergens (Peanuts & Tree Nuts)” as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Your allergen preventive control procedure states, “(b)(4).” However, your manufacturing sequencing does not account for products that contain walnuts, and you manufacture chocolate-covered Fudge Walnut, Maple Walnut, and Fruit and Nut (walnut) Eggs on shared equipment such as conveyor belts, which are food contact surfaces. Enrobing records indicate that you manufactured chocolate-covered Maple Walnut Eggs(b)(4), followed by chocolate-covered pretzels (no walnut) without cleaning in between products. Additionally, your procedures (e.g., “Food Safety Plan for Chocolate Enrobing Department (April 2020)” regarding allergen cross-contact do not include written corrective action procedures that must be taken if preventive controls are not properly implemented (see 21 CFR 117.150(a)).
3. You did not implement written procedures for environmental monitoring, as required by 21 CFR 117.165(b)(3). Specifically, you manufacture RTE chocolates that are exposed to the environment at the enrobing, cooling, and packaging steps. In your “Food Safety Plan for Wrapping & Packaging & Labeling of Finished Products (April 2020),” you identify recontamination with pathogens, specificallySalmonella, as a hazard requiring a preventive control. Your sanitation preventive control procedure requires environmental monitoring as verification and states, “Environmental swa[b] testing of(b)(4).” However, you did not implement this procedure as you only performed environmental monitoring once for the year 2021 (on May 24, 2021).
4. You did not establish and implement a risk-based supply-chain program for those raw materials and other ingredients for which you have identified a hazard requiring a supply-chain-applied control, as required by 21 CFR. 117.405(a)(1). You identifiedSalmonellaas a hazard “caused by contaminated product” (and thus requiring a preventive control) in your Food Safety Plan for Chocolate Enrobing Department (April 2020). However, you did not identify any supplier controls forSalmonellain chocolate among the preventive controls you apply for chocolate used for enrobing.Salmonellain chocolate is controlled during the manufacture of the chocolate; a knowledgeable person manufacturing/processing chocolate products would identify supplier controls for the hazard ofSalmonellain chocolate. With regard to other hazards requiring a supply-chain applied control, we note that your Food Safety Plan for Wrapping & Packaging & Labeling of Finished Products (April 2020) identifies heavy metals and mycotoxins as hazards for chocolate, and your preventive control for these are COAs for each truckload of chocolate from your supplier (verified by lab testing(b)(4)). However, you did not approve your chocolate supplier in accordance with 21 CFR 117.410(d), and you have not established written procedures for the receipt of your chocolate ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 117.420 and 21 CFR 117.475.
Current Good Manufacturing Practice (Subpart B):
5. You did not take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that all persons working in direct contact with food wash hands (and sanitize if necessary to protect against contamination with undesirable microorganisms) after each absence from the workstation and at any other time when hands may have become soiled or contaminated, as required by 21 CFR 117.10(b)(3). Specifically,
a. On April 1, 2022, an employee walked into the production area, handled paperwork, and then, without washing and sanitizing their hands, proceeded to straighten maple cream centers(b)(4), with bare hands, on the enrober line as they were being conveyed to the chocolate bottomer.
b. On April 4, 2022, while producing jersey creams on your enrober line, your enrober supervisor crawled under the conveyor belt on bare hands and knees to check the chocolate melter below the line. Then, without washing or sanitizing their hands, picked up 15 candies that were not completely covered in chocolate and, with bare hands,(b)(4)placed them back onto the conveyor belt before the enrober, to be processed back through the chocolate waterfall.
6. You did not take reasonable precautions and measures to ensure that eating food or chewing gum is confined to areas other than where food is exposed, as required by 21 CFR 117.10(b)(8). Specifically, on March 25, 2022, an employee was chewing gum while hand-forming the fruit and nut fudge filling for your 8 oz. Fruit and Nut Fudge Eggs. Your management stated that they had never heard chewing gum or eating during food production was not acceptable.Misbranding:
Additionally, during this inspection, our investigators obtained product labeling and manufacturing records for several of your products that you sell in bulk to retail stores. We have reviewed the labeling and found the products you manufacture and distribute are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343) as follows:
1. Your bulk Chocolate Coated Pretzels product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product case label fails to declare the major food allergen “wheat,” as required by section 403(w)(1) of the Act. The pretzels are made using wheat flour, but wheat is not listed on the case label.
2. Your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams and bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(a)(1) of the FD&C Act in that the labeling is false or misleading. The case labels and the retail placard labels for the products fail to reveal the material fact that the identified flavors are artificially derived. As required by 21 CFR 101.22(i)(2), when a food contains any artificial flavor which simulates, resembles or reinforces the characterizing flavor, the name of the food on the principal display panel or panels of the label shall be accompanied by the common or usual name(s) of the characterizing flavor, in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters used in the name of the food and the name of the characterizing flavor shall be accompanied by the word(s) “artificial” or “artificially flavored,” in letters not less than one-half the height of the letters in the name of the characterizing flavor, e.g., “artificial vanilla,” “artificially flavored strawberry,” or “grape artificially flavored.”
3. Your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams, bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams, and bulk Chocolate Coated Pretzels products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that they are fabricated from two or more ingredients and each ingredient is not declared on the label, as required by 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
a. Your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams product is manufactured using raspberry puree; however, you fail to list the puree or all of its sub-ingredients on your finished product case label. Further, the retail placard label fails to list the artificial raspberry flavor used in the product and lists red raspberries instead of the raspberry puree and its complete sub-ingredients including corn syrup, sugar, water, dextrose, carrageenan gum, and the color red 40. The placard label also lists wheat, which is not an ingredient in the product.
b. The case labels and retail placard labels for your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams, bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams, and bulk Chocolate Coated Pretzels products fail to list the correct ingredients for the chocolate coating used, in that the coating’s butterfat, whey powder, and lactose ingredients are not declared. Further, the labels list ingredients for the chocolate coating that are not in the coating, such as milk.
c. The case label for your Chocolate Coated Pretzels fails to list the sub-ingredients of the pretzels, including wheat flour. The retail placard labels for your Chocolate Coated Pretzels lists ingredients that are not present in the product, such as egg whites and sodium bicarbonate.
d. The case label bears the statement, “The candy may contain one or more of the following ingredients.” The following are examples of ingredients that are declared on the product labels that are not in that specific product:
i. Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams: lists wheat, which is not an ingredient in the product.
ii. Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams, bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams, and bulk Chocolate Coated Pretzels products: the labels list ingredients for the chocolate coating that are not in the coating, such as milk.
iii. Chocolate Coated Pretzels (retail placard labels): lists ingredients that are not present in the product, such as egg whites and sodium bicarbonate.
iv. The case labels for your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams, bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams, and bulk Chocolate Pretzels products list numerous ingredients that are not present in the products, including, but not limited to, semi-sweet chocolate and its sub-ingredients, confectionary coating and its sub-ingredients, walnuts, peanuts, almonds, pecans, raisins, coconut, cream butter, and cherries.
When designing labels that are suitable for more than one similar product or for use on packages of assortments, see CPG Sec. 505.100 Bakery Products, Candy - ""Catch-All"" or ""Shotgun"" Ingredients athttps://www.fda.gov/ICECI/ComplianceManuals/CompliancePolicyGuidanceManual/ucm074420.htm.
4. Your bulk Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams and bulk Milk Chocolate Maple Creams products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(1) of the Act [21U.S.C. §343(i)(1)] in that the product case labels fails to bear the common or usual name of the food. The Milk Chocolate Red Raspberry Creams case label lists “L Raspberry” and the Milk Chocolate Maple Creams case label lists “L Maple” as the statements of identity, which are not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3.
5. Your Milk Chocolate Raspberry Creams product is misbranded under section 403(k) of the Act because the product contains an artificial coloring, flavoring, or a chemical preservative but does not bear labeling stating that fact. Specifically:
a. Your firm provides placard labels to your retail customers to be used on their bulk retail displays. FD&C Red No. 40 is an ingredient in the raspberry puree used in the Milk Chocolate Raspberry Creams product but is not declared by its listed name or an appropriate abbreviation on the placard label for the product, as required under 21 CFR 101.22(k).b. The retail placard label for the Raspberry Cream product fails to declare the preservatives, sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate, which are ingredients in the raspberry puree ingredient, as well as flavors such as artificial red raspberry flavor.c. The case labels list numerous preservatives. However, their function is not declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We have the following comments regarding your labels:
Please note that the nutrition labeling exemptions found in 21 CFR 101.9(j)(1) and 21 CFR 101.36(h)(1) apply to retailers with annual gross sales of not more than $500,000, or with annual gross sales of foods or dietary supplements to consumers of not more than $50,000. For these exemptions, a notice does not need to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
Or, if your firm employs fewer than an average of 100 full-time equivalent employees and sells fewer than 100,000 units of that product in the United States in a 12-month period then your firm may qualify for the nutrition labeling exemption for low-volume products under 21 CFR 101.9(j)(18).
We recommend you review the above nutrition labeling exemptions to see if your firm qualifies for the exemption, then reviewhttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/small-business-nutrition-labeling-exemption-guidancefor information on filing for an annual exemption. The application may be submitted online at:https://www.cfsanappsexternal.fda.gov/scripts/NLE/client/login.cfm
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER
November 16, 2022
RE: 628753
Dear Mr. Sanders:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address CBDAmericanShaman.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We also reviewed your social media websites at www.instagram.com/cbdamerican and www.facebook.com/cbdamericanshamanproducts, which link to your website cbdamericanshaman.com, to purchase your products. FDA has determined that your CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, CBD Honey, Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)], because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, CBD Honey, Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)].
FDA is particularly concerned that some of your products are in forms that are appealing to children. For example, your CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, various Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, and various CBD Gummies products are all in forms that would be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children. Furthermore, your products have not been evaluated by the Agency for safety, effectiveness, and quality. As discussed below, CBD has been studied as a drug, and it is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children. For example, children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.
You also market other products that consumers may confuse with traditional foods for humans, including CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, and CBD Honey; therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the CBD ingredient by consumers.
In addition, “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is an unapproved new drug introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355(a)], and is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(ee)]. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a)]. These violations are described in more detail below.
Further, the claims on your website and social media websites establish that your Canine 300 Tincture, Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Canine 300 CBD and Terpene Rich Hemp Oil Water Soluble, Feline 300 Tincture, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs products, which you promote as products containing CBD for use in pets, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)].
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Adulterated Human Foods and 301(ll)
According to your product labeling, your CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, and CBD Honey products are foods to which CBD has been added. We analyzed a sample of your Grandma’s Raisin & Pecan Hermit Cookies and confirmed that the product contains CBD. We also note that you may intend to promote your 10mg CBD Gummies, CBD Gourmet Gummies, CBD Energy Gummies, and Sugar Free CBD Gourmet Gummies as conventional food products. Specifically, you describe these gummy products as “adult gummy candy” and/or “the perfect way to satisfy your sweet tooth,” and the web pages for three of the products bear Nutrition Facts information.As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)], and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. The available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD added to conventional food. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)] and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 348]. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Therefore, your CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, and CBD Honey products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. To the extent you intend to promote your 10mg CBD Gummies, CBD Gourmet Gummies, CBD Energy Gummies, and Sugar Free CBD Gourmet Gummies as conventional food products, they would be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] for the same reason.
Further, in regard to your Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, CBD Suckers, CBD Hard Candies, CBD Sparkling Tea, CBD Sparkling Water, CBD Coffee, CBD Honey Sticks, and CBD Honey, and, to the extent you intend to promote your 10mg CBD Gummies, CBD Gourmet Gummies, CBD Energy Gummies, and Sugar Free CBD Gourmet Gummies as conventional food products, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Human Drug and Misbranded Human Drug
“CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is a “drug” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)], because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C)], because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as sunscreen.
Examples of claims from the product’s labeling, including the claims observed on your website, www.cbdamericanshaman.com, that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product includes, but may not be limited to, the following:
“CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen . . . BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 35+ UVA • UVB” [from the label on your website, https://cbdamericanshaman.com/cbd-sunscreen]
“Drug Facts . . . Active Ingredients [s] . . . Cannabidiol (Hemp Exract [sic] (Aerial Parts), Cannabidiol) 0.072% . . . Purpose . . . Sunscreen . . .” [from the label on your website, website, https://cbdamericanshaman.com/cbd-sunscreen]
“This all natural CBD sunscreen lotion is a natural way to protect yourself from harmful UV rays while using an all-natural product that won’t harm you or our planet! This cbd infused sunscreen is 35+ SPF (broad spectrum) and is rated to block UVA and UVB rays. We use Zinc Oxide which is rated safe by EWG on their Skin Deep website and isn't hazardous for the environment like oxybenzone or octinoxate. There is 60mg of nano full-spectrum CBD oil per container.” [from the product information on your website, https://cbdamericanshaman.com/cbd-sunscreen]
Based on the above labeling claims, “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is a topical product intended for use as a sunscreen drug. As described below, this sunscreen drug is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
In general, a drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)], if it is not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling; and in general, new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355(a)]. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355], is in effect for this drug product.
“CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is a sunscreen drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355h], which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application —commonly referred to as ""OTC monograph drugs""—may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. In particular, sunscreen drug products are deemed to be GRASE and not a “new drug” if, among other things, they conform to the conditions of use set forth in the Over-the-Counter Monograph M020: Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (hereinafter M020).3However, this sunscreen drug product does not conform to the conditions of use specified in M020 because the product’s labeling lists CBD as an active ingredient in the Drug Facts panel. CBD is not an active ingredient allowed in any applicable final monograph. Thus, your “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” product does not meet the requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act, under which it would be deemed to be GRASE and not a new drug.
Furthermore, even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen,” this product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed because the product would not be eligible for marketing under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, such a product would not meet the conditions under section 505G(a)(1) or (2), insofar as it would not conform with the general requirement in 21 CFR 330.1(e) that inactive ingredients must be safe and suitable.4A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance).5CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.
Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects6and must be safe when used at the intended dosage.7CBD, however, has a known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks.8It is unknown whether the level of CBD used in your “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” drug product has pharmacological activity or poses any concern for safety events. Accordingly, CBD cannot be considered a safe and suitable inactive ingredient as required under 21 CFR 330.1(e). Consequently, if CBD is intended to be an inactive ingredient in your “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” product, that product would not meet the general requirements for legal marketing of nonprescription drugs under sections 505G(a)(1) or (2) of the FD&C Act.
In addition, FDA is not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in its labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which this product would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, this product is an unapproved new drug marketed in violation of sections 505(a) of the FD&C Act. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d)].
In addition, “CBD + ZINC OXIDE Sunscreen” is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(ee)] because it is a nonprescription drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355h], is not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355], and does not comply with the requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355h]. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such a product into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a) and (d)].
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website cbdamericanshaman.com and your social media websites, www.instagram.com/cbdamerican and www.facebook.com/cbdamericanshamanproducts, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs Canine 300 Tincture, Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Canine 300 CBD and Terpene Rich Hemp Oil Water Soluble, Feline 300 Tincture, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs. Based on our review of your website and social media websites, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website that show the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
• On your webpage titled “CBD Dog Treats” under the header “How do CBD dog treats help your pup?”:o “You can use CBD American Shaman dog treats to relieve your furry friends with high levels of stress. We include CBD oil for dogs in each treat to help calm pets during a storm, firework show, loud party or any other situation that puts them in a state of panic.”o “They [CBD dog treats] may also help regulate heartbeat and blood pressure”
• On your webpage titled “How To Choose A CBD Oil Product” under the header “Dogs”:o “If you would like to give your dog CBD every once in a while, like before the vet, for 4th of July fireworks, or when your dog may be extra anxious, we recommend any of our Dog CBD oils (https://cbdamericanshaman.com/pets) and Soft CBD Dog Treats (https://cbdamericanshaman.com/soft-cbd-dog-treats).”• On your webpage titled “How To Choose A CBD Oil Product” under the header “Cats”:o “Our feline CBD (https://cbdamericanshaman.com/feline-cbd-hemp-oil-tincture) oils are also great for when your cat needs help calming down or relaxing before a triggering event.”
Examples of claims observed on your social media websites that show the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
• On your October 13, 2021 Instagram and Facebook posts: “Does your dog need support for #jointhealth or experience storm stress? Our unique recipe of high-quality CBD oil dog treats taste like peanut butter and will leave your pet wanting more.”• On your February 23, 2018 Facebook post: A photo of a dog is posted by CBD American Shaman with the caption “#funfactfriday: CBD Oil is becoming more and more available for use on pets! In FACT, veterinarians are finding #cbdoil useful in arthritis, stress, digestive issues, and much more.”o A comment on this post and response from CBD American Shaman: Comment from follower: “I am considering trying this for our dog who had seizures.” Response from CBD American Shaman: “A lot of people are having success with their dogs [sic] seizures using CBD.”
• On your October 16, 2017 Facebook video post:o At the 20 second mark in the video a graphic states, “From arthritic canines to anxiety filled equines, CBD Oil is changing the way veterinarians and pet owners treat their furry family members.”o At the 28 second mark in the video a graphic with the heading “CBD Hemp Oil” states, “Whether a dog has cancer, seizures, or anxiety, cannabis oil can serve as an alternative medication to help treat symptoms.”
• On your September 27, 2017 Facebook post: “Animals have anxiety, joint discomfort, and many of the same disorders as humans. So, just as with our human line of products, we use the best of ingredients for our canine, feline, or equine customers.”
Your CBD-containing products for animals are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(v)], because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1]. These products are not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 360b(a)], and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5)]. Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, your Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs products are animal food to which CBD has been added. Specifically, the product labeling depicted on your website, cbdamericanshaman.com, refers to your Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, and Horsey Chews, as a “treats.” Additionally, your Doggy Nugs and Kitty Nugs are referred to as food, for example, on your webpage titled, “How To Choose A CBD Oil Product,” a link is provided to the product page for your Doggy Nugs and states, “If you are seeking CBD benefits for your dog on a daily basis, we recommend our CBD Dog Food, which is made with real chicken and is bowl-licking good.” On the same webpage titled, “How To Choose A CBD Oil Product,” a link is provided to the product page for your Kitty Nugs and states, “If you are seeking an easy way to give your cat CBD on a daily basis, try our CBD cat food made with real chicken.” Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.9
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)], and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal food. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal food are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 348]. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 348], an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Therefore, your Doggy Chews (all flavors), Soft & Tender Doggy Chews, Horsey Chews, Doggy Nugs, and Kitty Nugs are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of this adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We have the following additional comments:
According to the label of your Grandma’s Raisin & Pecan Hermit Cookies [with] 10mg CBD per Serving, the product contains 10 mg CBD per one cookie serving. We collected a sample and analyzed this product and confirmed that the product contains CBD. However, FDA analysis found significantly higher levels of CBD than declared on the label, at 19.3 mg CBD per serving and 17.6 mg CBD per serving in our original and check analyses, respectively. As stated above, failure to accurately list the amount of CBD in the product further increases the risk associated with consumption of the product. We have significant concerns about products marketed with incorrect statements about the amount of CBD, particularly those that contain higher amounts of CBD than labeled because consumers may be consuming more CBD than intended. Nevertheless, even if the product labels were accurate regarding the level of CBD in the product, the product would still be adulterated because it bears or contains an unsafe food additive, as discussed above.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website indicates that you intend to market some of your CBD products as dietary supplements. For example, the images of the labels on the product pages of your Rapid Dissolve CBD Tablets, CBD Capsules, VG Cloud Tinctures, Water Soluble Hemp Oil Extract, Gourmet Gummies Hemp Oil Isolate, Gourmet Gummies Energy, CBD Gummies, and Sugar Free Gourmet Gummies all bear the term “dietary supplement.” Your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)]. Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355], or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.10There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 628753” in the subject line of your email.

1Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
2CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
3Section 505G(a)(1) of the FD&C Act specifies criteria under which certain nonprescription drugs without an approved application are deemed GRASE and not ""new drugs"", notably conformance with conditions detailed in applicable OTC monograph documents issued by FDA under 21 CFR 330, prior to enactment of the CARES Act. In the case of OTC sunscreen drug products, relevant documents were deemed under section 505G to be a final administrative order, Over-the-Counter Monograph M020: Sunscreen Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use. (See Order ID OTC000006, available at FDA’s website OTC Monographs@FDA,https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/omuf/.)
421 CFR 330.1(e) requires that “the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity.”
5See e.g., ""Using the Inactive Ingredient Database"" Guidance for Industry (July 2019), p. 1 at https://www.fda.gov/media/128687/download, and ""Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients"" Guidance for Industry (May 2005), pp. 1-2 athttps://www.fda.gov/media/72260/download.
6See e.g., 21 CFR 314.3(b) and 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), which define an active ingredient as “any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man.” All other components of a finished drug product are considered inactive ingredients (see CFR 314.3(b), 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8)).
7See 21 CFR 330.1(e).
8For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf.
9Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5)], new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.
10As noted above, CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex and the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public.

RE: #629248
Dear Mr. Marshall:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://cbdinfusionz.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, all of which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/cbdinfusionz and www.instagram.com/cbdinfusionz, which direct consumers to your website https://cbdinfusionz.com to purchase your products. FDA has determined that all strengths, varieties, and various flavors of your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)], because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)].
FDA is particularly concerned that some of your products are in forms that are appealing to children. For example, your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, and CBD lollipops products are all in forms that would be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children. Furthermore, your products have not been evaluated by the Agency for safety, effectiveness, and quality. As discussed below, CBD has been studied as a drug, and it is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children. For example, children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites. You also market other products that consumers may confuse with traditional foods for humans, including your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, and CBD lollipops products; therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the CBD ingredient by consumers.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Adulterated Human Foods and 301(ll)
According to your product labeling, your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products are foods to which CBD has been added. Specifically, the products bear Nutrition Facts labels and/or your website provides “Nutrition Facts” for these products. We have analyzed and confirmed that samples of your gummy, gum, and lollipop products contain CBD.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). To the extent you intend to promote your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products as conventional food products, they would be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] for the same reason.
Further, in regard to your CBD gummies, CBD fruit snacks, CBD gum, CBD candy, CBD oil/tinctures, and CBD lollipops products as conventional food products, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.

This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Additionally, we have the following comment:
We are concerned that it appears your firm is marketing the following products intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals: CBD Dog Treats (Bacon & Cheddar Cheese Flavored) and Hemp CBD Tincture (also referred to as CBD Coconut Oil – CBD MCT Oil Broad/Full Spectrum). These products are marketed on your website and social media websites for intended uses including, but not limited to, separation anxiety, noise aversion, and seizures. There are FDA approved animal drugs to treat these conditions. If not treated appropriately, these conditions can have detrimental health and welfare consequences for animals. We also note that CBD is not an approved food additive and the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

FDA has determined that your flavored Chill Shots, all strengths and varieties, CBDFx Mixed Berry Gummies 1500mg, CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)], because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your flavored Chill Shots, all strengths and varieties, CBDFx Mixed Berry Gummies 1500mg, CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)].

Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a)]. These violations are described in more detail below.
Further, the claims on your website and social media websites establish that your CBD-containing products for animals including Dog Tincture (all strengths), Cat Tincture, Pet Tincture (all breed sizes/strengths), Pet Tincture (also referred to as CBD Oil for Cats), Stress and Anxiety Pet Treats, Joint and Mobility Pet Treats, and Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm (hereinafter all called “your CBD-containing products for animals”) are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.

Adulterated Human Foods and 301(ll)
According to your product labeling, your CBD Chill Shots, and CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, are foods to which CBD has been added. We analyzed a sample of your CBD Lemonade Chill Shot and CBD Chocolate Chip Cookies with Protein 20mg products and confirmed that the product contains CBD. We also note that you may intend to promote your Mixed Berries Gummies 1500mg as a conventional food product. Specifically, you describe these gummy products as “Gummies— like classic gummy bears — are one of the most popular candy treats on the planet. People love the burst of flavor that comes with these delicious chews.“
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1

Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Therefore, your CBDFX Mixed Berries Gummies 1500mg, CBD Chill Shots, and CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)]. To the extent you intend to promote your CBDFX Mixed Berries Gummies 1500mg, CBD Chill Shots, and CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, products as conventional food products, they would be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] for the same reason.
Further, in regard to your CBD Chill Shots, and CBD Cookies with Protein 20mg, including Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Peanut Butter flavors, and to the extent you intend to promote your CBDFX Mixed Berries Gummies 1500mg as conventional food products, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)], prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media website, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and YouTube social media account that establish the intended use of your CBD-containing products for humans as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From your website www.cbdfx.com:
On the June 9, 2021 blog titled, “CBD FOR SLEEP: BEATING INSOMNIA THE NATURAL WAY,”:
• “CBD FOR SLEEP: BEATING INSOMNIA THE NATURAL WAY”• “Can CBD Help with sleep apnea? . . . In some areas, like sleep apnea, we have to rely on anecdotal evidence and our own reasoning” with the words “anecdotal evidence” hyperlinked to an article, “Finding a Natural Remedy for Sleep Apnea.” The article, “Finding a Natural Remedy for Sleep Apnea” includes statement such as, but not limited to:o “CBD for sleep apnea . . . helped both my husband and me get better sleep at night.”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of your CBD-containing products for humans for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:

In fact, this same article quotes multiple studies which showed CBD as effective when used for anxiety.”• “[T]his study in Neurotherapeutics, states that ‘preclinical evidence conclusively demonstrates CBD’s efficacy in reducing anxiety behaviors relevant to multiple disorders, including PTSD, GAD, PD, OCD, and SAD.’”

Based on the above labeling claims, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, your CBD-containing products for humans are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here,3new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your CBD-containing products for humans. There is no basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5). These products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, these products are considered prescription drugs and adequate directions for their use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products.4The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website cbdfx.com, and your social media websites www.facebook.com/CBDfx, www.instagram.com/cbdfx_/, and twitter.com/cbdfx, FDA determined that your firm is marketing CBD-containing products for animals that are unapproved new animal drugs: Dog Tincture (all strengths), Cat Tincture, Pet Tincture (all breed sizes/strengths), Pet Tincture (also referred to as CBD Oil for Cats), Stress and Anxiety Pet Treats, Joint and Mobility Pet Treats, and Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm. Based on our review of your website, and your social media websites, your CBD-containing products for animals are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website cbdfx.com and social media websites www.facebook.com/CBDfx, www.instagram.com/cbdfx_/, and twitter.com/cbdfx, that show the intended use of your products for animals as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
Dog Tincture (all strengths)• “Anti-inflammation: Relieving joint pain for active and older dogs”• “Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, many find that CBD can help with inflammation that causes joint and mobility pain in dogs, cats, and other pets.”
Cat Tincture• “Anti-inflammation: Relieving joint pain for active and older animals”• “Thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties, many find that CBD can help with acute and chronic inflammation that causes joint pain in cats and other pets.”
Pet Tincture (all breed sizes/strengths)• “We have all likely heard stories of CBD potentially helping with seizure disorders, pain control, anxiety, metabolic disorders, cancer, inflammation and nausea, just to name a few.”• On your Instagram social media website:o August 13, 2020 posting with photograph of a woman sitting next to and petting a dog in the back of a vehicle: “Specifically designed for dogs (and cats!), our Pet Tinctures help manage the stress and anxiety that often accompanies a long car ride.⁠”• On your Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook social media websites:o June 7, 2020 postings with photograph of a dog looking at three containers of your pet tincture products: “I love this stuff! Especially when my hooman [sic] leaves for what seems like forever and I feel anxious.”
Pet Tincture (also referred to as “CBD Oil for Cats”)• “CBD can relieve stress, anxiety, and hyperactivity...”
Stress & Anxiety Pet Treats• “These all-natural, vegan CBD dog biscuits are perfect for settling nerves and easing stress, which can lead to more harmful anxiety.”
Joint & Mobility Pet Treats• “CBD has anti-inflammatory properties that can help relieve aches and pains your dog may be experiencing. CBD dog biscuits can be just the thing to get your dog up and moving again.”• “With anti-inflammatory benefits... CBD can provide a potent ingredient in products for joint and muscle pain in dogs and other pets.”
Calming and Moisturizing Pet CBD Balm• “Not only does this CBD balm for pets feature hemp-extracted CBD… These fatty acids strengthen the skin, assist it in combating infection, and have multiple anti-inflammatory properties.”• “As with dogs, a cat’s skin, paws and nose can dry out, and get irritated, inflamed or infected. So, it’s a good idea for cat owners to also keep CBD Calming and Moisturizing Pet Balm on hand…”
Your CBD-containing products for animals are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, your Stress & Anxiety Pet Treats and Joint & Mobility Pet Treats products are animal foods to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your product labels depicted on your website, cbdfx.com, include the claim “Contains Superfoods...” Additionally, your product page for Stress & Anxiety Pet Treats includes the following descriptions: “And your dog will love the natural sweet-potato flavoring!” and “CBD Dog Treats for Stress and Anxiety are all-natural, organic, non-GMO, human-grade and vegan...” Further, your product page for Joint & Mobility Pet Treats includes the following descriptions: “Made with organic broad spectrum CBD, powerful antioxidants...these...CBD dog treats come in a tail-wagging sweet-potato flavor, sure to delight even the most finicky of pooches!” and “These tasty CBD dog treats contain broad spectrum CBD, plus other antioxidants and nutrients...” Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.5
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal food. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal food are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your CBD Pet Treats for Stress & Anxiety and CBD Pet Treats for Joint & Mobility are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated animal foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

The violations cited in this letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We offer the following additional comments:
CBD-containing Drugs
Even if your CBD Cream For Muscle & Joint and CBD Balm Stick Muscle & Joint were considered nonprescription drugs, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. CBD is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).6, 7
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website indicates that you intend to market your CBDFx Mixed Berry Gummies 1500mg,Turmeric and Spirulina CBDFX Gummies, Sleep Gummies with Melatonin 1500mg CBDFX Gummies, Apple Cider Vinegar 1500mg CBDFX Gummies, Multivitamin CBD Gummies for Women and Men, CBD+Delta-9 THC Capsules Daily Chill Blend, and Focus Mushroom+CBD Drops and CBG Energy Blend products as dietary supplements; for example, the products’ pages bear Supplement Facts panels or the product is labeled as a “CBD Supplement” or “Hemp-Derived Supplement.” However, your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.8There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to the United States Food and Drug Administration at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. Please include “CMS 629243” in the subject line of your email.

1Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
2CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
3For example, under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met, including conformity with an applicable OTC monograph. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on your claims regarding these products, including on your website labeling, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications. Further, even if certain of your products, such as your CBD Cream For Muscle & Joint and CBD Balm Stick Muscle & Joint, were marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application. For example, CBD—considered an active ingredient under 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) due to its prominent featuring on your product labeling—is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
4Further, even if your products were marketed only for nonprescription indications, these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section (see footnote 2) and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.
5Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5)), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.
621 CFR 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered."" A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.
7Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.
8CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER
November 16, 2022
RE: # 628036
Dear Mr. Venezia:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.naturallyinfused.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you represent as products containing cannabidiol (CBD) or Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.instagram.com/naturallyinfusedcbd/ and at https://www.facebook.com/Naturally-Infused-CBD-CBG-335285106887519/; these websites direct consumers to your website www.naturallyinfused.com to purchase your products.
FDA has determined that your CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, CBD Infused coffees, D8 THC Infused coffees, and Delta-8 THC Gummies products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, and CBD Infused coffees products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
Further, the claims on your website and social media websites establish that all strengths and varieties of CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, CBD Infused coffees, CBD Isolate in MCT Oil, CBD Plus CBG in MCT Oil, CBD/CBG/CBN Isolates in MCT Oil, CBD/CBG/CBN/Delta 8 THC, Full Spectrum Oil CBD, Roll & Rub CBD Oil, and Spray & Rub CBD (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD-containing products for humans”) are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD-containing products. FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. See https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
As stated above, the Agency is particularly concerned that some of your products are in forms that are appealing to children. For example, your CBD Lollipops, CBD Gummies, and Delta-8 THC Gummies are in forms that would be attractive to children and could easily be mistaken for traditional foods that are commonly consumed by children. Furthermore, you market other products that consumers may confuse with traditional foods for humans, including CBD Infused Sugar and CBD and Delta-8 THC Infused coffees. Therefore, there is a risk that consumers of these products, including children, will unintentionally consume CBD or Delta-8 THC ingredients. Additionally, we note that the CBD coffee products appear to contain caffeine. Evidence suggests that CBD may affect caffeine metabolism and may increase and/or prolong caffeine’s effects.
Your products have not been evaluated by the Agency for safety, effectiveness, and quality. As discussed below, CBD has been studied as a drug, and it is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations, such as children. For example, children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.
The Agency has also collected and analyzed samples of your CBD Lollipops and CBD Infused Sugar products and has confirmed the presence of cannabinoids in the products. We have particular safety concerns with the CBD Lollipops product, which was purchased from your website and did not have a label on the packaging indicating that the lollipops contain CBD. A consumer, including a child, could easily mistake the product for a traditional lollipop candy.
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, and CBD Infused coffees products are foods to which CBD has been added.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, and CBD Infused coffees products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, according to your product labeling, your D8 THC Infused coffees and Delta-8 THC Gummies are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your D8 THC Infused coffees and Delta-8 THC Gummies are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your CBD Lollipops, CBD Infused Sugar, CBD Gummies, and CBD Infused coffees are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites listed above, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your CBD-containing products for humans as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From your website https://naturallyinfused.com/articles.html, webpage titled, “Articles,” that lists links to pages with articles and blog posts, including:
• A link to an article entitled, “A Primer About Cannabidiol and the Benefits of CBD,” which contains claims such as, ""CBD is a powerful anti-epileptic, anti-depressant . . . muscle relaxant, sedative . . .”• A link to an article entitled, “CBD and Bipolar Disorder,” which contains claims such as, “research suggests that certain cannabinoids found in marijuana, i.e. THC and CBD, may have significant mood-stabilizing properties that could be beneficial for patients with bipolar disorder. . . CBD seems to counter the psychoactive effects produced by high doses of THC and may also possess anti-anxiety, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties of its own.”
From your social media website https://www.facebook.com/Naturally-Infused-CBD-CBG-335285106887519/:

Go To: NaturallyInfused.com”3Your CBD-containing products for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned CBD-containing products for humans.
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. See 21 CFR 201.5. The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome).

RE: 627690
Dear Mr. Schnell:
This letter is to advise you that in October 2022 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address mood33.com, which is provided on the product label for your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products that contain added cannabidiol (CBD). FDA has determined that your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products into interstate commerce under sections 301(ll) and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll) and 331(a).
FDA is particularly concerned that your products are in a form (herbal tea or beverage) that consumers may confuse with traditional foods. The Agency has collected and analyzed a sample of your product and has confirmed the presence of CBD in the product. Therefore, with these products there is a risk of unintended consumption of the CBD ingredient by consumers, which is exacerbated due to the failure of the label to list CBD as an ingredient. Further, we note that the Joy Peach-Yerba Mate and Energy Raspberry Lemon-Guayusa-Green Tea varieties also appear to contain caffeine. Evidence suggests that CBD may affect caffeine metabolism and may increase and/or prolong caffeine’s effects.
You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Adulterated Human Foods and 301(ll)
Your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products are foods to which CBD has been added. As stated above, FDA collected a sample and confirmed that it contains CBD; the product label for this product stated that the product contained cannabinoids derived from hemp (“with 33mg Full Spectrum Hemp Derived Cannabinoids”). Your website bears analytical reports that list the CBD content in your products ranging from 21.30 mg CBD per unit to 35.50 mg CBD per unit. Furthermore, your press page at https://mood33.com/press/, which endorses the linked articles under the heading “Get the latest buzz on mood33 Hemp-Infused Teas,” has links to articles stating that your products use “proprietary CBD microencapsulation.” These linked articles include “A cup of CBD tea? mood33 launches hemp-infused herbal tea range” posted on December 3, 2019, and “mood33 launches new line of hemp-infused herbal teas,” posted on December 2, 2019.
As defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.1
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)) and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. The available data raises serious concerns about potential harm from CBD added to conventional food. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted.

As stated above, according to your product labeling and our analysis, your Mood33 Hemp Infused Herbal Tea products are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.

RE: 636311
Dear Mr. Chen and Mr. Hoyt:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.arterosil.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your Arterosil product. The claims on your website establish that Arterosil is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that Arterosil is intended for use as a drug include the following:
On your Arterosil product page at www.arterosil.com:
""Arterosil® - the only glycocalyx regenerating product patented to stabilize and regress vulnerable plaque…""
“The primary contributors to breakdown of the endothelial glycocalyx are high blood glucose, oxidative stress and inflammation. Pathologies associated with impaired endothelial glycocalyx include: Coronary heart disease, Hyperglycemia, Diabetes, Renal diseases, Lacunar stroke, Severe trauma…”
""Leukocyte Adhesion Study….Finding: Arterosil prevents the increase of leukocyte adhesion and inhibits endothelium-mediated inflammation""
Under the “Patient Education” Tab
""What you need to remember is that LDL can only cause problems if it lodges in the artery wall. A healthy glycocalyx can slow or stop that from happening.""
""MRI Carotid Plaque Regression Study….Finding: Arterosil caused a significant reduction of lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC) of carotid atherosclerotic plaque""
""Plaque Reduction Retrospective Case Study….Finding: Arterosil caused a significant reduction of artherosclerotic [sic] plaque.""
""Hypertension Study….Finding: Arterosil significantly lowered diastolic blood pressure""
""Diabetic Neuropathy Study….Finding: Arterosil improved objective and subjective measures of neuropathy.""
Your Arterosil product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, Arterosil is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product Arterosil is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, Arterosil fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, Arterosil is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your product is not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to Dr. Aaron Dotson, Compliance Officer, United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5001 Campus Drive, Office of Compliance (HFS-608), Division of Enforcement, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835 or via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.

Dear Mr. Jay Decker:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://bergametna.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your Cholesterol Command product. We also reviewed your social media website,www.facebook.com/BergametNorthAmerica.com which directs consumers to your website, https://bergametna.com to purchase your product. Additionally, we reviewed the product listing on www.walmart.com, where your product is available for purchase.

“BergaMet products follow the correct dosage and extract concentrations used and recommended in recent clinical studies as a bergamot supplement for high cholesterol . . . and help improve blood vessel function”
Your websites also contain evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Cholesterol Command for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:On your testimonial page at https://bergametna.com/pages/testimonials:
“Love Cholesterol Command! My ldl is down 28 points, my doctor was extremely surprised because I am allergic to statins so working on my cholesterol levels has been difficult until I found out about BergaMet ... haven’t seen my cholesterol this low in 15 years”
On your Facebook page at www.facebook.com/BergametNorthAmerica.com:
On a graphic titled “CAN CITRUS BERGAMOT [an ingredient in your Cholesterol Command product] IMPROVE YOUR CHOLESTEROL?” posted on March 14, 2022, you endorsed the following customer replies:
o “Yes, it really works! my bad cholesterol drooped by 60 pts . . .” You endorsed this testimonial by responding, “That is amazing Jon!

Thank you for sharing”o You also endorsed the following responses to your post by liking them:􀂃 “I just got my blood test back my total cholesterol went down 56 points and my bad cholesterol went down 82 points.”
“Yes!! Mine went down 38 points.”
Your Cholesterol Command product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)].

""In patients undergoing surgery for cardiopulmonary bypass, those receiving CoQ10 treatment were significantly less likely to require inotropic drugs after surgery and to develop ventricular arrhythmias. Also, a randomized controlled multicenter trial evaluated CoQ10 as adjunctive treatment in 420 patients with chronic heart failure. Long- term CoQ10 treatment was found to be safe, improve symptoms, and reduce major adverse cardiovascular events. In another study, the administration of CoQ10 to heart transplant candidates led to significant improvements in functional status, clinical symptoms, and quality of life.""
""[I]mprovement in plasma CoQ10 was correlated with both clinical improvements and improvement in left ventricular function in heart failure patients""
""The ubiquinol form of CoQ10 is beneficial for people who may have increased needs for CoQ10 or who are at high risk for decreased conversion of ubiquinone to ubiquinol, such as those on statins or other CoQ10 depleting medications, older individuals, and those with certain health conditions, especially heart disease.""

Dear Madam/Sir:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://iwilife.com/ in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your iwi Cholesterol product. We also reviewed your social media website, www.facebook.com/MyiwiLife/, which directs consumers to your website, https://iwilife.com/, to purchase your product. Additionally, we reviewed your Amazon and Walmart product pages for iwi Cholesterol at www.amazon.com and www.walmart.com, respectively, where your product is available for purchase. The claims on your websites establish that iwi Cholesterol is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
On your iwi Cholesterol product page at https://iwilife.com/products/natural-cholesterol-supplement:
“Clinically shown to decrease cholesterol”
“Protect your heart by lowering bad cholesterol”
“Almega®PL, our proprietary form of EPA-only omega-3 [an ingredient in your iwi Cholesterol product]…has been clinically demonstrated in a trial with 104 participants to significantly decrease total cholesterol against placebo. In particular, ‘bad’ VLDL cholesterol decreased by 25% on average in just 3 months.”
The product’s name (iwi Cholesterol) is an implied claim that it reduces cholesterol.
On your Amazon product page at www.amazon.com:
“iwi’s signature ingredient readily increases the Omega-3 Index – a biomarker for reduced cardiovascular risk.”
“This plant-based supplement significantly decreases total cholesterol and bad (non-HDL) cholesterol without decreasing good HDL Cholesterol…”
On your Walmart product page at www.walmart.com:
“iwi’s signature ingredient readily increases the Omega-3 Index – a biomarker for reduced cardiovascular risk.”
“This plant-based supplement significantly decreases total cholesterol and bad (non-HDL) cholesterol without decreasing good HDL Cholesterol…”
On your Facebook page at www.facebook.com/MyiwiLife/:
March 28, 2022: “In America, an estimated 15% of the heart health related deaths (54,626) each year are linked to low intake of EPA and DHA Omega-3 fatty acids [ingredients in your iwi Cholesterol product]. DHA and EPA are shown to support heart health by decreasing plaque-forming blood lipids (i.e., triglycerides, cholesterol)…”
Your iwi Cholesterol product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product iwi Cholesterol is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, iwi Cholesterol fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product.

RE: 636305
Dear Mr. Ben Flohr and Ziv Haklili:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.essentialelementsnutrition.com in August 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your CholestAid product. Additionally, we reviewed product listings on your Amazon storefront at https://www.amazon.com/stores/EssentialElements/page/79EC556B-D9DC-48C2-86C3-78442954381D?ref_=ast_bln, which directs consumers to your Amazon product page to purchase your product. The claims on your websites establish that CholestAid is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
On your CholestAid product page at www.essentialelementsnutrition.com/product/cholesterol:

""Essential elements® CholestAid helps you keep cholesterol levels under control.""
""Vitamin B3, red yeast rice, and pine bark extract [ingredients in CholestAid] supply a natural way to help your body lower bad cholesterol levels""
""Encouraging higher “good” cholesterol levels, your body is better able to clear out the bad cholesterol building up within arteries and naturally manage cholesterol levels.""
“Niacin and niacinamide [ingredients in CholestAid] … work by helping reduce enzymes that break down “good” HDL cholesterol while also preventing cells from releasing the low-density lipoproteins that can cause cardiovascular issues.”

“[R]ed yeast rice [an ingredient in CholestAid]… has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol by helping inhibit cholesterol production in the liver.”
“The key ingredients in Essential elements CholestAid are the niacinamide and red yeast rice. Powerful on their own, in combination with each other and the rest of the CholestAid formula, they help improve heart health and better manage cholesterol levels. Furthermore, both have been shown in studies to help lower “bad” LDL cholesterol levels as well as triglycerides and even blood pressure.”

Dear Mr. Robert Norris:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.chambersapothecary.com in October 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your Blood Pressure Support and CoEnzyme Q10 products. The claims on your websites establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
On your Blood Pressure Support product page at https://www.chambersapothecary.com/product/bloodpressure-support/:
“In regard to the herbal blend, research suggests Hawthorn extract (Crataegus oxyacantha) [an ingredient in Blood Pressure Support] may help control high blood pressure and cholesterol by increasing coronary artery blood flow and improving circulation. Coleus forskohlii [an ingredient in Blood Pressure Support] contains a chemical called forskolin, which is known for having the ability to reduce blood pressure. Hops strobiles (Humulus lupulus) [an ingredient in Blood Pressure Support] contains specific flavonoids that have the potential to lower blood pressure... Taurine [an ingredient in Blood Pressure Support] is a naturally occurring amino sulfonic acid and may lower blood pressure ....”

“May lower cholesterol”
“May decrease muscle breakdown, pain and discomfort for people taking statins.”
“May lower blood pressure”
“May improve health of blood vessels in those with ... heart disease.”
Your Blood Pressure Support and CoEnzyme Q10 products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Blood Pressure Support and CoEnzymeQ10 are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes.

WARNING LETTERCMS #625768
Dear Mr. Shea:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your dietary supplement manufacturing facility located at 1606 Vantage Dr., Carrollton, TX 75006-5613 on October 18-22, 2021, conducted as a follow-up to an inspection conducted at your facility April 8-May 6, 2021, and a meeting held with you on August 6, 2021. During the inspection, we identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page atwww.fda.gov.
We received e-mail correspondences from you dated November 16 and December 9, 2021, written in response to the Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your responses below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The violations include the following:
1. You failed to establish the required specifications for points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). You do not have written specifications to ensure the consistent production of your(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4)products:a. For the components you use in the manufacture of your dietary supplements, you failed to establish:1. An identity specification, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1).2. Component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement manufactured using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2).3. Limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).b. You failed to establish in-process specifications for any point, step, or stage in the MMR where control is necessary to help ensure that specifications are met for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(c)(1).c. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
We received and reviewed your responses, dated November 16 and December 9, 2021. These responses included a “Certificate of Quality” for(b)(4). In your responses, you stated that this(b)(4)“spec sheet” specifies the data tested from the third-party testing lab(b)(6)qualitative and quantitative analysis, but you did not provide any supporting documentation regarding these analyses or any information providing the basis on which these analyses could be used to establish product specifications. For example, the analytical methods used were not provided, and the specification of “POSITIVE” provides no information on which we can evaluate the scientific validity of the methodology used for your purported identity specification. Further, your responses do not address any of the(b)(4)dietary supplement products manufactured by your facility that were reviewed by the investigators during the inspection and identified as not having finished product specifications established for points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR.
Once you have established specifications, you must determine whether the specifications are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95(b).
Related to your responses of November 16 and December 9, 2021, we also note that your responses indicate you will verify finished product specifications by monitoring “various steps” in the manufacturing process. Even if your established specifications were adequate, this method of confirming that such specifications have been met is an inadequate method for determining if finished product specifications have been met. You have not identified a method on how to determine product specifications.
2. You failed to prepare and follow an MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, which includes all required information, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a) and 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, when we requested your MMRs during the inspection, your firm could not provide a complete, written MMR for each dietary supplement for every batch size for the following dietary supplements:(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4). The documents provided as MMRs lacked the following required information:a. The strength and concentration of each dietary ingredient for each batch size [21 CFR 111.210(a)];b. A complete list of components to be used [21 CFR 111.210(b)];c. An accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)];d. The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)];e. A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient [21 CFR 111.210(e)];f. A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)]; g. A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)]; andh. The following written instructions:i. Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)];ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)];iii. Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)];iv. Special notations and precautions to be followed [21 CFR 111.210(h)(4)]; andv. Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met [21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)].
We received and reviewed your responses, dated November 16 and December 9, 2021. Your responses included the documents “MMR-1-(b)(4),” “MMR-2-(b)(4),” and “MMR –(b)(4)(observ 4),” submitted as examples of your revised MMR’s. The MMRs provided fail to demonstrate the sufficiency of your corrective action because they do not meet the above-listed requirements of 21 CFR 111.210. In addition, you did not provide MMRs for the(b)(4)products reviewed during the inspection and identified on the FDA 483 as lacking MMR’s ((b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4)).
3. Your batch production record (BPR) did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, when we requested your BPRs during the inspection, your firm could not provide a complete, written BPR for the following dietary supplements:(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4). The documents provided as BPRs lacked the following required information:a. The identity of equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch [21 CFR 111.260(b)];b. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs where the information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)];c. The unique identifier that you assigned to each component, packaging, and label used [21 CFR 111.260(d)];d. The identity and weight or measure of each component used [21 CFR 111.260(e)];e. A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at the appropriate phases of processing [21 CFR 111.260(f)];f. The actual results obtained during any monitoring operation [21 CFR 111.260(g)]g. The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)];h. Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination and for packaging and labeling [21 CFR 111.260(i)];i. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the date on which each step of the master manufacturing record was performed and the initials of the persons performing each step [21 CFR 111.260(j)];j. Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including the unique identifier you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels; an actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the MMR; and the results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements, or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results [21 CFR 111.260(k)];k. Documentation, at the time of performance, that the quality control personnel reviewed the BPR; approved or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging; approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution; and approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)];l. Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)]; andm. Documentation at the time of performance of any reprocessing [21 CFR 111.260(n)].
We received and reviewed your responses, dated November 16 and December 9, 2021. Your responses included examples of BPR’s and “Sub-BPR’s”. The responses fail to demonstrate the sufficiency of your corrective action because the documents provided fail to include all required information under 21 CFR 111.260, and they fail to provide any information pertaining to the(b)(4)products reviewed during the inspection and identified on the FDA 483 as lacking BPR’s ((b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4)).
4. You failed to examine, before packaging and labeling operations, packaging and labels for each batch of dietary supplement to determine whether the packaging and labels conform to the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.410(c). Specifically, your firm’s MMR did not include all ingredients listed on the finished product label, and product is released as such.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements related to product complaints, as required by 21 CFR 111.553. Specifically, your firm management stated during the inspection that your firm does not record or track complaints in an official manner, and your standard operating procedures have no procedure for handling complaints.
You must ensure product complaints are reviewed and investigated, as required by 21 CFR 111.560, and that written records of your written procedures for products complaints and every product complaint related to good manufacturing practice are made and kept, as required by 21 CFR 111.570.
We received and reviewed your responses, dated November 16 and December 9, 2021. Your responses included the documents “Complaint Log Physical observation 11” and “ComplaintLogDigital observation 11,” which consist of photos of a physical file folder named “Complaint Log 2021” and a digital file folder, respectively. The responses fail to demonstrate the sufficiency of your corrective action because you did not provide any supporting documentation to show that your complaint procedures have been implemented.
Misbranding Violations
1. The “(b)(4),” “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4)” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
The directions of use for the “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” products suggest the consumer take “4” capsules daily, “2” capsules in the morning and “2” capsules in the afternoon; in this case, the serving size should be two capsules.
The directions for use for the “(b)(4)” product suggest the consumer take “3-5” capsules per day split between meals. The serving size listed should be specific to what is to be consumed in a single eating occasion. You provide an example of consuming one capsule with lunch and two capsules with dinner. In this example, the serving size should be two capsules.
2. The product “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because each label fails to declare the correct number of servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii). The number of servings must be calculated from the serving size, that being the maximum amount per eating occasion, and the total contents of the package.
3. The(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because it does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
4. The(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4),(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:a. The(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4)products declared (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and other dietary ingredients on each Supplement Facts label are not provided in the order and format prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36 which requires the (b)(2)-ingredients to be listed first followed by a heavy bar and then other dietary ingredients.b. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)product labels each bear the following statement: “Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000-calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).c. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label declares incorrect % DVs for thiamine, Vitamin B6 and Vitamin B12; likewise, % DV for thiamine in the(b)(4)product does not appear to be rounded to the nearest whole percent. Furthermore, the quantitative amount of thiamine should be rounded to the nearest tenth of a milligram. For both products, the listing of “DV%” is incorrect but may be listed as “% DV”. Finally, the “%” symbol must follow each numerical value listed as a DV.d. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label should use the term “mcg” instead of “ug” as the unit of measure for the Vitamin B12.e. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label incorrectly declares as a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, “Vitamin K (as menaquinone-7)”. 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) lists an RDI for vitamin K of 120 mcg basedon the AI (adequate intake) that pertains only to phylloquinone. Menaquinone-7 should be listed as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredient.f. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)Supplement Facts labels incorrectly list potassium chloride, potassium citrate, or calcium bisglycinate, as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredients. Potassium, chloride, and calcium are each a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient and must be listed with the other (b)(2)-dietary ingredients if the quantitative amount by weight per serving) is at least 2% of the RDI.g. The(b)(4)product label fails to place the “Other Ingredients” list below the Supplement Facts label.h. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label incorrectly declares % DV for Total Sugars when then there is no DV for Total Sugars. The Supplement Facts label lists sodium and cholesterol in amounts that can be declared as zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).i. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label incorrectly lists “0% DV” for the Total Carbohydrate. Per 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C), the % DV should be declared as “Less than 1%” or “< 1%” for the % DV. In addition, calories per serving are incorrectly listed; calories must be expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment up to and including 50 calories, per 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1).
5. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically,a. The(b)(4)label fails to declare the standardized common name of “tragacanth milkvetch” for the declared dietary ingredient “Astragalus gummifer”, as listed in the reference(b)(4).b. The(b)(4)label fails to declare the standardized common name of uva-ursi for the declared dietary ingredient “Arctostaphylos uva-ursi (Bearberry; leaf), as listed in the reference(b)(4).
6. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are each misbranded in that the FDA disclaimer declared on each product label is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(c).
7. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are each misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that each product label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.

RE: 631755
Dear Mr. McMillon:
This letter concerns your firm’s distribution of the “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” product that violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”). As discussed below, your firm is responsible for introducing, delivering, or causing the introduction or delivery into interstate commerce of this product, which is an unapproved new drug under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, this product is a misbranded drug under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a). You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
FDA purchased “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” through your website, www.walmart.com. The product, which is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), was introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by Walmart via your Walmart Fulfillment Services.1FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that the “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” purchased on Walmart.com contained the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) diclofenac, which is not listed on the product label.2Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).3, 4NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. The undeclared diclofenac ingredient in “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Unapproved New Drugs
“Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on the labeling of “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” that establish the intended use of this product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“PROPRIEDADES” (English translation:PROPERTIES)
“Altamente eficaz en la reconstruccion del cartílago.” (English translation:Highly effective in restoring cartilage.)
“Combate la artritis.” (English translation:Fights arthritis.)
“Detiene el avance de deterioro en articulaciones.” (English translation:Stops the progress of joint deterioration.)
“Antiinflamatorio y analgésico.” (English translation:Anti-inflammatory and analgesic.)
“Eficaz en problemas de articulaciones de lesiones deportivas.” (English translation:Effective for joint problems due to sports injuries.)
“Beneficia a personas que padecen de procesos degenerativos como artritis y osteoartritis.” (English translation:Benefits people suffering from degenerative processes such as arthritis and osteoarthritis.)
“Mejora la movilidad y normal funcionamiento de las articulaciones.” (English translation:Improves mobility and normal functioning of joints.)
“Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and therefore is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3.” Introduction or delivery of this product into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 301(d), 21 U.S.C. 331(d), and 505(a), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) of the FD&C Act.
In addition, “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” does not declare that the products contain the drug ingredient diclofenac. As discussed earlier, diclofenac can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, or serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines, or liver toxicity including liver failure that can cause the need for a liver transplant or death. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the product’s labeling renders “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The introduction, delivery for introduction, or causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of past or present violations that may exist in connection with the products you distribute. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

3Please be advised that under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act, unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Voltaren (containing diclofenac sodium as the active ingredient) as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Prior to that date, diclofenac had not been marketed as a food or dietary supplement. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Voltaren was approved, a product marketed as a dietary supplement that contains diclofenac is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act. Furthermore, a product marketed as a dietary supplement that is intended for the treatment of arthritis is also a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
4We also note that the labeling of the product appears to violate Walmart’s policies prohibiting dietary supplements with disease claims from being listed on Walmart Marketplace: https://gecrm.my.salesforce.com/sfc/p/61000000ZKTc/a/4M000000LnEm/YFluE07nRPxGwEBEosayC29sEDWdKBGNLikZxfiLL8c.

RE: 631751
Dear Mr. Jassy:
This letter concerns your firm’s distribution of “Artri Ajo King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” (hereinafter “Artri Ajo King”), “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” products that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FD&C Act”). As discussed below, your firm is responsible for introducing, delivering, or causing the introduction or delivery into interstate commerce of these products, which are unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a), 301(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a), 331(d), and 355(a). You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
FDA purchased “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” products through your website, www.amazon.com. These products were introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce by Amazon via your Fulfillment by Amazon service.1FDA confirmed through laboratory analyses that the “Artri Ajo King,” “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” purchased on Amazon.com contained the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) diclofenac, which is not listed on the product labels.2
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAIDs may cause increased risk of cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, as well as serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal perforation of the stomach and intestines. The undeclared diclofenac ingredient in “Artri Ajo King,” “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” may also interact with other medications and significantly increase the risk of adverse events, particularly when consumers use multiple NSAID-containing products.
Information on the labels and/or labeling of “Artri Ajo King,” “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey,” and “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3” demonstrates that the sampled products are marketed as dietary supplements.3However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i), a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved diclofenac, under the trade name Voltaren, as a new drug on July 28, 1988. Prior to that date, diclofenac had not been marketed as a food or dietary supplement. Given that diclofenac was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Voltaren was approved, “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey,” which contain diclofenac, are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Moreover, we note regardless of whether these products are excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement, they are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for, among other things, use as an arthritis treatment.4
Unapproved New Drugs
“Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on the labeling, including the outer packaging, of “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey.” Introduction or delivery of these products into interstate commerce without an approved application violates sections 301(d), 21 U.S.C. 331(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act.
In addition, “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” are misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a). Under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n), provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The respective labeling for “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” does not declare that the products contain the drug ingredient diclofenac. As discussed earlier, diclofenac (and other NSAIDs) can lead to adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attack and stroke, or serious gastrointestinal damage, including bleeding, ulceration, and fatal tears of the stomach and intestines, or liver toxicity including liver failure that can cause the need for a liver transplant or death. The failure to disclose this ingredient in the products’ labeling renders “Artri Ajo King,” “Artri King Reforzado con Ortiga y Omega 3,” and “Ortiga Mas Ajo Rey” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.
The introduction, delivery for introduction, or causing the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

FDA reviewed your website at www.purgesports.com in May 2022 and September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products THERMX™ Powder and HYPEX Powder. The claims on this website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On the product webpage for THERMX™ Powder, a product containing chromium (https://purgesports.com/collections/purge-products/products/thermx#ingredients):
“Chromium is an essential mineral with a role in insulin regulation and glucose management. It affects chromodulin, which improves its ability to enhance insulin receptor activity.”
On the product webpage for HYPEX Powder under “Ingredient Profile” (https://purgesports.com/collections/purge-products/products/hypex#ingredient-profile):

FDA reviewed your website at https://www.musclemilitia.com/ in May 2022 and September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the product RECOMP Capsules. The claims on this website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
On the product webpage for RECOMP Capsules (https://www.musclemilitia.com/products/recomp):

FDA reviewed your website at www.kodiaksupps.com, which redirects to https://musclesport.com/collections/alpha-series, in May 2022 and September 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Attack™ Pre-Workout Powder and Coma™ Sleep & Recovery Activator Lemon Drop Powder. The claims on this website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On the product webpage for Attack™ Pre-Workout Powder under “Ingredient Profile” (https://musclesport.com/collections/alpha-series/products/attack-pre-workout):
“Citrulline Malate . . . converts to nitric oxide. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator that can help to lower blood pressure . . . .”
“Arginine . . . has been studied for healing wounds . . . and preventing tissue degradation in people with critical illnesses.”
On the product webpage for Coma™ Sleep & Recovery Activator Lemon Drop Powder under “Ingredient Profile” (https://musclesport.com/products/coma-sleep-aid):
“Reductions in glycine receptor stimulation or function . . . promote REM sleep behavior disorder.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products CardioBurn For Her Powder, IMMUNITY + Powder, and HYPEX Powder are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, CardioBurn For Her Powder, IMMUNITY + Powder, and HYPEX Powder fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
The Supplement Facts panel of your product RECOMP Capsules declares Bitter Orange Extract (Citrus aurantium) (see musclemilitia.com/products/recomp under Supplement Facts tab), and your product webpage for the RECOMP Capsules states, “Bitter orange extract contains neuroactive agents, synephrine, hordenine, and octopamine” (musclemilitia.com/products/recomp under “Ingredients” tab). Your website does not provide enough information for us to determine whether hordenine and octopamine have been added to RECOMP Capsules as ingredients or are present in trace amounts as components of Bitter Orange Extract. We also do not know whether these compounds are present in their original biogenic form or as synthetically produced salts (e.g., hordenine HCl).FDA recently sent warning letters to several firms selling dietary supplements containing hordenine, hordenine HCl, or octopamine as ingredients. See “FDA Sends Warning Letters to Multiple Companies for Illegally Selling Adulterated Dietary Supplements” and May 4, 2022 warning letters to, e.g., Ironmag Labs (hordenine) and Max Muscle (hordenine HCl and octopamine). Although FDA does not have enough information at present about the composition of RECOMP Capsules to take a position on whether the product is adulterated because of the presence of hordenine and octopamine, it is your responsibility to take any action necessary to ensure that your distribution and sale of RECOMP Capsules does not violate the Act, including evaluating whether the product contains any substances that render it adulterated.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Lillian C. Aveta, Compliance Officer, 158-15 Liberty Ave., Jamaica, NY 11433 or via email at Lillian.aveta@fda.hhs.gov (preferred). If you have any questions about the content of this letter, please contact Ms. Aveta at 718-662-5576 or email atLillian.aveta@fda.hhs.gov.

1There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described in the body of this letter, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Menke:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, located at 1001 S. 3rd Street West, Missoula, Montana, on September 14-17 and 28, 2021. During the inspection, our investigators collected product labels for your products. Based on the inspectional findings and subsequent review of your product labels and labeling, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
We received your correspondence sent electronically on October 13, 2021, November 11, 2021, and December 22, 2021, concerning our inspectional observations listed on the FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address this response below as it relates to the noted observations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection revealed serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The significant violations of CGMP requirements observed during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You failed to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, you have not provided adequate documentation of your basis for determining that compliance with the specification(s) selected under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(1), through the use of appropriate tests or examinations conducted under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(2), will ensure that your finished batch of dietary supplements meets all product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, and the limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to the adulteration of, the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c)(3), for the following finished products manufactured at your facility:(b)(4).
We have received your responses dated October 13, 2021, November 11, 2021, and December 22, 2021; however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action. In your responses, you provided an updated Certificate of Analysis for(b)(4)Lot Number(b)(4), an updated Certificate of Analysis for(b)(4)Lot Number(b)(4); as well as Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) SOPQA2025,(b)(4)Testing for Finished Dietary Supplement Product, SOPPE1001 Development of Release Specifications for Components and Labeling, and SOPPE1002, Development of Finished Product and In-process Specifications. However, your responses do not provide documentation to support that you are verifying that the finished dietary supplements meet established product specifications.
2. Your quality control personnel failed to follow your written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, your written procedure, SOPQA1008, Quality Assurance Authorities and Responsibilities, states your Quality Assurance (QA) authorities have the responsibility to “[r]eview and approve decisions for investigating product complaints”. The Quality Assurance sections of QA-705-C v9, Manufacturing Defect (MD) Intake and Preliminary Investigation Form, which documents the receipt and visual inspection of returned product and whether to investigate the complaint, was not completed and approved by quality assurance for complaint records 50638, 50643, 50652, 50656, and 50469.
We have received your responses dated October 13, 2021, November 11, 2021, and December 22, 2021. In your responses, you stated you have retrained applicable personnel and started addendums to the referenced complaints regarding investigations. Your corrective actions will be evaluated during the next inspection of your firm.
3. You failed to verify that the laboratory examination and testing methodologies are appropriate for their intended use, as required by 21 CFR 111.320(a). Specifically, you conducted identity tests for multiple dietary ingredients within a blend by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). For the blends(b)(4)Lot(b)(4)Lot(b)(4), and(b)(4)Lot(b)(4), FTIR could not identify the individual dietary ingredients within the blend. While FTIR may be used to verify that the supplier is consistent in sending the same component, FTIR does not ensure that the component received is what it is claimed to be when the component is a blend with multiple ingredients.
We have received your responses dated October 13, 2021, November 11, 2021, and December 22, 2021; however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. In your responses, you stated you have, or are working with a third-party laboratory to develop reference standards for components and finished products using methodologies including(b)(4), as applicable, but did not provide further evidence or documentation of the development of the reference standards.
4. You failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, previously released lots of glycerin,(b)(4)yeast, and(b)(4)powder used in manufacturing, were used as reference standards in FTIR analysis; however, you failed to establish any criteria to establish a reference standard. Further, you failed to demonstrate that the non-compendia standards originating from these lots were thoroughly characterized to ensure their identity, purity, quality, and strength. Non-compendia reference standard materials should be of the highest purity by reasonable effort and should be thoroughly characterized to ensure their identity, purity, quality, and strength. Once characterized, the official qualification documentation of these standards must be reviewed and approved by Quality Control prior to use, as required by 21 CFR 111.110(a).
We have received your responses dated October 13, 2021, November 11, 2021, and December 22, 2021. We acknowledge that you have purchased a reference standard for glycerin and discontinued the use of(b)(4)powder within products. Regarding the component(b)(4)yeast, although your responses identified that you have adopted Lot(b)(4)as a reference standard and provided supporting documentation for characterization, you did not provide an explanation as to why Lot(b)(4)was chosen as the reference standard. Further, your document DQL1010, Testing Requisition and Summary Report: Components state your identity specification for the reference standard as “conforms” without defining acceptance criteria so that a decision can be made to accept or reject test material against the reference standard.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, the(b)(4)products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 101, and as follows:
1. The(b)(4)and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label, as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
a. The(b)(4)label’s directions state to “Take 1-2 chewable tablets daily as needed, at bedtime.”, but the serving size listed in the Supplement Facts label is 1 tablet.
b. The(b)(4)label’s directions state ""Adults should take 1 tablet twice daily. Children aged 7-16 years should take 1 tablet daily."" Thus, the amount recommended on the label per eating occasion is 1 tablet, but the serving size listed in the Supplement Facts label is 2 tablets.
2. The(b)(4)Calcium, and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label declares the dietary ingredients “Vitamin B3”, “Vitamin B5”, and “Vitamin B7”. However, “Vitamin B3”, “Vitamin B5”, and “Vitamin B7” are not synonyms specified for niacin, pantothenic acid, or biotin, respectively, as noted in 21 CFR 101.9 or 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).b. The(b)(4)Facts label declares “Vitamin B1” and “Vitamin B2”. While each of these alternative names is an acceptable synonym for thiamine and riboflavin, respectively, the synonym must parenthetically follow the name of the nutrient in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2). Furthermore, the source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from"", in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
c. The(b)(4)Facts label bears the following statement: “Percent daily values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
d. The(b)(4)Facts label fails to place pantothenic acid before biotin, as noted in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
e. The(b)(4)Facts label (for the(b)(4)Calcium product and as included in the(b)(4)product) declares the term “Vitamin K (as(b)(4))” as a (b)(3)-dietary ingredient. We note the term Vitamin K, as stated in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), only applies to the (b)(2)-dietary ingredient phylloquinone [81 FR 33742, at 33905 and 33935].
f. The(b)(4)Facts label declares the serving size as 2 tablets. However, the Supplement Facts label fails to include the nutrition information for children aged 7-16 years for which the serving size is 1 tablet, per the Directions for Use. The percent of Daily Value shall be based on Recommended Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV) values for adults and children 4 or more years of age, unless the product is represented or purported to be specifically for infants through 12 months of age, children 1 through 3 years of age, pregnant women, or lactating women, in which case the column heading shall clearly state the intended group. If the product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns as shown in paragraph (e)(11)(ii) of this section, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).
g. The(b)(4)Facts label fails to place a % mark following each of the numerical values pertaining to the % DVs, as noted in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B).
3. The(b)(4)Calcium, and(b)(4)products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (i)(2)] in that source ingredients and a dietary ingredient fail to be declared on the label by the common or usual name, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4 and 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. The(b)(4)Facts label (for the(b)(4)Calcium product and as included in the(b)(4)product) declare the names “(b)(4)minerals” and “(b)(4)”.
b. The Vitamin Code Growth Factor product included in the(b)(4)product declares “(b)(4)” on the Supplement Facts label.
c. The(b)(4)Facts label (for the(b)(4)Calcium product and as included in the(b)(4)product) declares the source ingredient “(b)(4)” as well as the (b)(3)-dietary ingredient “(b)(4)”, each of which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
1. Regarding Deviation MDD(b)(4)’s out of specification result for your product(b)(4), Lot(b)(4), your initial result for the subject sample was 3650 colony forming units per gram (cfu/g), which exceeded the specification of No More Than (NMT)(b)(4)cfu/g. Your retest of this product yielded a result of 725 cfu/g, which is within specification; however, we observed the following:
According to your procedure SOPQL3004, Total Aerobic Plate Count, “if a plate contains less than(b)(4)cfu, record number of cfu, but do NOT use these counts to determine the final average cfu/g. Plates with <(b)(4)cfu may be inaccurate”. You averaged a plate count of 1 in the final average result for the retest.
You stated that the result of(b)(4)cfu/g is acceptable(b)(4). The results show that the colony count did not exceed the maximum acceptable count of(b)(4)colonies established by(b)(4). Furthermore, the maximum acceptable count does not negate meeting the established specification of(b)(4)cfu/g.
In addition, regarding Deviation MDD(b)(4)’s out of specification result for the product Turmeric(b)(4)Caps Lot(b)(4), your initial result for the sample was 8200 cfu/g, which exceeded the specification of(b)(4)cfu/g. Your retest yielded a result of 250 cfu/g; however, in your procedure SOPQL3069, Microbial Data Deviation Investigation, it states “[i]f one or more of the test results do not confirm the original result, further investigation may be necessary.” You did not document that a further investigation was performed, and you did not document why further investigation was not necessary. Despite this, new samples were prepared and analyzed. The result of the new sample was 300 cfu/g, which was accepted.
We ask for clarification regarding these noted items regarding the deviation investigations related to(b)(4), Lot(b)(4)and Turmeric(b)(4)Capsules, Lot(b)(4).
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Amy R. Glynn, Compliance Officer, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021-4421. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Compliance Officer Glynn at 425-302-0411.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Ms. Martin-Buresh and Mr. Buresh:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1601 NE Hemlock Avenue, Redmond, Oregon, on September 20, 2021, through September 24, 2021. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products, including Stress Guard, Aller-Aid, Eyes Love Lutein, TumeriPro, Prostate Health, Kids Tranquil Child, Kids Echinacea Goldenseal, CountToZen, Milk Thistle Elixir, Ashwagandha Gingko, Sleep Better, Hawthorn, Bilberry, Cordyceps, and Black Cohosh to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
We received your email correspondence dated October 15, 2021, December 15, 2021, February 11, 2022, April 12, 2022, and June 8, 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your responses below, in relation to the noted violations.
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have not established specifications for the strength and composition of the dietary ingredients in the formulation of your Kids Tranquil Child and Eyes Love Lutein.
We have reviewed your responses dated October 15, 2021, and December 15, 2021, in which you communicated your plan to update all finished product specifications and provide progress updates to FDA. Neither of these responses included revised specifications for the products referenced in the relevant observation.
In your response dated February 11, 2022, you stated that you have updated specifications for 30 finished dietary supplements; however, you provided specifications for only one product not referenced above, as an “example” (Oat Straw Tops c/s COG 4 oz). For this product, the identity specification relied on microscopy, but no characteristic morphology was provided. You also claimed there is no scientifically valid method for determining strength, and that composition is determined by weighing the bag of product; these specifications are not adequate.
In your response dated April 12, 2022, the Finished Product Specification sheet for Eyes Love Lutein, which you provided as an example, is inadequate because it does not contain a strength specification for the dietary ingredient Organic Bilberry Fruit. Also, the specification sheet described the “Genus & species” of this product as Pullulan capsules; this particular descriptor does not apply to your finished product and also would be inaccurate even if applied to the Organic Bilberry Fruit dietary ingredient because “pullulan” is a starch used to make capsules.
In your latest response, dated June 8, 2022, you provided specifications for your product Ashwagandha - Organic, which you described as an “[e]xample of a master specification that has been recently updated.” The specifications provided in this document are inadequate for the reasons we describe below. For the identity specification, you listed organoleptic techniques in conjunction with microscopic analysis or(b)(4)analysis. You stated, “[i]dentify using microscopic analysis and verify that results confirm the presence of relevant diagnostic characters as described on the product specific Form 354 Microscopic Analysis Report (the standard for the ingredient).” However, your response dated December 15, 2021, included only a blank template Form 354. No completed Form 354 with the standard characteristics of Ashwagandha was provided to serve as a “standard” for comparing the sample. You mentioned(b)(4)as an alternative identification method, but you provided no(b)(4)conditions and no description of how a reference standard will be procured for the analysis. You stated, “Potency is undiluted ingredient, and no scientifically valid method exists for testing this product specification.” Potency is the strength of the ingredient, and common high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods exist for testing the strength of Ashwagandha. Also, you previously stated that you will continue to use input as a strength “test” method in cases where no other strength test method is available. Testing by input is not an acceptable method.
FDA has found each of the examples of revised finished product specifications that you have sent us in your responses to be inadequate.
2. You failed to ensure that the tests and examinations that you used to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically, you did not have appropriate, scientifically valid methods to ensure that the identity specification for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement is met. Furthermore, you did not have appropriate, scientifically valid methods to ensure that your identity and strength specifications for your finished dietary supplement are met. For example:
a. Specifications for “potency herb strength” for the total of all the dietary ingredients in liquid dietary supplements such as Kids Echinacea Goldenseal, CountToZen, and Milk Thistle Elixir are verified by calculation and input into the batch. Relying solely on the amount input is not a valid scientific method of confirming that specifications for strength of the finished batch are met.
b. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is used as part of the identity and composition testing for bulk blends such as those for Stress Guard, Aller-Aid, Eyes Love Lutein, TumeriPro, Prostate Health, Kids Echinacea Goldenseal, CountToZen, and Milk Thistle Elixir. During the inspection, you stated that FTIR methodology cannot identify the presence of individual dietary ingredients included in these products.
c. Your acceptance criteria for identity testing of(b)(4)botanical components by FTIR is(b)(4)% match to the reference standard. Your results of the identity testing of Nettle(b)(4)lot(b)(4)for Aller-Aid and Cordyceps(b)(4)lot(b)(4)for Cordyceps showed the tested material has greater than(b)(4)% match to the reference standard of the component and several other components (Catnip tops have an 86.38% match,(b)(4)have a 86.25% match,(b)(4)has a 86.09% match, Calendula Flower has an 86.02% match, Yarrow Flower has a 85.12% match and Thyme Leaf has a 84.92% match), with no differentiation of the standard and the other components. There is no assurance that your FTIR methodology provides the requisite specificity and that it is scientifically valid for identifying(b)(4)botanicals.
You stated in your October 15, 2021, response that for dietary supplements, “[c]omposition and strength will be determined by calculation and input where current and generally available analytical methods do not exist to establish product specification testing.” You may exempt one or more product specifications from verification requirements under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(1) if you determine and document that the specifications you select for determination of compliance with specifications are not able to verify that the production and process control system is producing a dietary supplement that meets the exempted product specification and there is no scientifically valid method for testing or examining such exempted product specification at the finished batch stage, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(d)(1). In such a case, you must document why, for example, any component and in-process testing, examination, or monitoring, and any other information, will ensure that such exempted product specification is met without verification through periodic testing of the finished batch. However, you have not prepared such documentation to exempt any of these specifications from finished product verification. In your response, you also included a revised master manufacturing record (MMR) with finished product specifications for TumeriPro. You determined the identity and strength of all dietary ingredients in the TumeriPro product (turmeric, bromelain, and citrus bioflavonoids) using HPLC methodology. However, your response is inadequate because you did not provide appropriate, scientifically valid methods for the testing of all your finished dietary supplements.
Your February 11, 2022, response stated that you are reducing your use of FTIR for identification testing and restricting its use to only those raw materials or components that are purified substances with a purity of at least(b)(4)% and where validation requirements are met. You further indicated that you are moving towards HPLC and(b)(4)to test to specifications for any remaining raw materials and components. Your response is inadequate because you did not provide an appropriate, scientifically valid method to ensure that the identity and strength specifications for all of your finished dietary supplements are met.
In your response dated April 12, 2022, you stated that you will significantly reduce the use of FTIR for identification testing, and instead plan to use HPLC,(b)(4), and microscopic analysis where applicable. Your response is inadequate because you provided no specific(b)(4)or HPLC methodology or reference standard information to ensure that the identity and strength specifications for all your finished dietary supplements are met for each specific dietary supplement. Furthermore, you continue to maintain that you will determine the composition and strength of some of your dietary supplements by calculation and input. Your response is inadequate because input is not a valid test method to determine strength.
In your latest response, dated June 8, 2022, you provided specifications for your Ashwagandha - Organic finished product. You continue to maintain that you will determine the strength of some of your dietary supplements by input. Your response is inadequate because input is not a valid test method to determine strength.
3. Your quality control personnel failed to reject a component or dietary supplement when an unanticipated occurrence took place during the production and in-process control systems that results in or could lead to the adulteration of a component or dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(1).
Specifically, when allergen, filth, and other foreign materials were detected in components for dietary supplements during visual examination, your quality control personnel failed to reject the lot of the component. For the following components that contained visible foreign materials, your records (OWH Material Review/Re-Work Forms #119-06) indicated that if the components came to your facility in multiple bags of the same lot, in some cases you rejected the material in the bags that contained visible pieces of foreign material and approved the material in the other bags. In other cases, you appear to have approved bags of component material after(b)(4)removing the foreign materials and using visual confirmation that all foreign material was removed. Your records indicate that allergens, filth, and other foreign materials were detected in the following components for which your quality control personnel approved a portion of the lot and your firm used it in production:
Wheat and rock foreign material were detected in Ashwagandha Root COG(b)(4)component lot(b)(4); a portion of the lot was approved and released by your QC personnel and appears to have been used in the manufacturing of Ashwagandha Gingko Capsules and Stress Guard Capsules.
Tree nut shells, peanut shell, corn, rodent feces, and seed foreign material were detected in Ashwagandha Root COG(b)(4)component lot(b)(4); a portion of the lot was approved and released by your QC personnel and appears to have been used to manufacture Ashwagandha Ginkgo, Sleep Better, and Stress Guard products.
Walnut and corn foreign material were detected in Hawthorn Berry COG Whole component lot(b)(4); a portion of the lot was approved and released by your QC personnel and appears to have been used to manufacture Hawthorn products.
Tree nut shell, glass, hard plastic, and rodent feces foreign material were detected in your Bilberry Fruit(b)(4)Whole component lot(b)(4); a portion of the lot was approved and released by your QC personnel and appears to have been used to manufacture Eyes Love Lutein and Bilberry products.
Glass, an AA battery, and tree nut shell foreign material were detected in your Black Cohosh Root component lot(b)(4); a portion of the lot was approved and released by your QC personnel and appears to have been used to manufacture Black Cohosh products.
Your investigation for Milk Thistle Seed COG Whole component lot(b)(4)contaminated with wheat grains demonstrates that(b)(4)removing the visible allergen from the component does not necessarily completely remove the allergen from the component. The material tested positive for gluten after the manual removing of visible grains. Note that foreign materials, such as allergens, broken glass, and rodent feces, may not be evenly distributed in the components and that the presence of visible foreign material may be an indicator of gross contamination. Removing the visible foreign material may not ensure the absence of contaminants.
Your response dated October 15, 2021, stated that you would revise your procedures for inspection and handling of major food allergens, a corrective action that is not broad enough to address all the concerns listed above. You stated that you would include justifications for inspections when you release part of a lot and reject another part of the same lot. However, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide revised procedures along with your response.
Your December 15, 2021, response documented allergen material found during an incoming inspection of whole valerian root from(b)(4)lots. However, your response did not document how many bags were in the lots and where the sample was selected from to form a representative sample per your SOP C-048, “Raw Material Inspection.” Per the material review form, the samples from(b)(4)lots were(b)(4)as a composite sample for testing at a third-party lab. The SOP does not address composite sampling of(b)(4)lots. Also, the SOP section on partial rejection does not identify Quality Control as responsible to make the determination that the material can be accepted for use in manufacturing. The SOP also does not provide that Quality Control will verify cleanliness and the absence of allergens by swabbing equipment.
In your responses dated April 12, 2022, and June 8, 2022, you did not address this specific observation; therefore, we cannot assess further progress towards compliance.
4. You failed to verify that the laboratory examination and testing methodologies are appropriate for their intended use, as required by 21 CFR 111.320(a). Specifically, you did not verify that your testing of components and dietary supplements for microbial contamination does not interfere with the reliability of the microbial test methods. Additionally, you did not verify that the in-house prepared media used for microbial testing are appropriate for their intended use.
We have reviewed your response dated October 15, 2021, in which you stated you will update your procedures, forms, and train employees. We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not include evidence of these corrective actions for review.
Your December 15, 2021, response stated that you are using USP and AOAC approved methods, and that no suitability testing is required for those AOAC methods because they have already been established as suitable for use with dietary supplements. You further indicated that you verified this approach after consulting with third-party experts. However, you did not provide the criteria for suitability. Therefore, FDA cannot determine that your methodology can accurately determine the microbial counts.
Your February 11, 2022, response did not include verification that testing of components and dietary supplements for microbial contamination does not interfere with the reliability of the microbial test methods.
Regarding your response dated April 12, 2022, you stated that your firm performed a side-by-side comparison of Petrifilm, USP, and FDA BAM methods for microbial testing. You stated that you determined the data indicated that the(b)(4)method was most suitable for your product. However, you did not provide any data, so we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your response at this time. When using methodology for microbial testing, it is important to verify that the dietary supplement powder is not inherently inhibiting microbial growth, which would invalidate the test method.
In your June 8, 2022, response, you provided SOPs for your microbiological testing of your finished dietary supplement products. We find your response inadequate because your procedures do not include a control for verification that the dietary supplement powder is not inherently inhibiting microbial growth.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition to the violations identified above, we offer the following comment:
Your firm includes expiration dates on the labels of the dietary supplement products including Stress Guard, Aller-Aid, Prostate Health, TumeriPro, and Eyes Love Lutein. During the inspection, you informed our investigators that your firm had organoleptically examined the products at expiration and used this examination to justify the listed expiration date. You stated that you do not have data supporting the expiration dates listed on the product labels. You asserted in your responses dated October 15, 2021, and December 15, 2021, that GMP regulations do not require expiration dating or a stability program. Your February 11, 2022, response stated that the SOP 080, “Expiration Date Determination” was revised and that the nonconformances that were the subject of this observation have been fully addressed. You did not provide a revised procedure along with your response, and you did not include additional corrections in your responses dated April 12, 2022, and June 8, 2022. Since you have elected to use a “Best By” and “Use By” date on your products, the date that you place on a product label should be supported by data that demonstrates the product’s shelf life [See 72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34856 (June 25, 2007)].
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021, to the attention of Tracy K. Li, Compliance Officer. If you have any questions concerning this letter, you can contact Ms. Li at (425) 302-0428.

July 29, 2022
Dear Mr. Koita:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 363 E 169th St, Bronx, New York from November 29, 2021 to January 10, 2022. Based on our inspection and subsequent review of product labeling collected during the inspection, your firm’s website at the Internet address https://deggeh.com/, and your Facebook social media page at https://www.facebook.com/pages/ category /Community/Deggeh-products-Natural-Organic-products-made-in-Gambia-564035160361406/, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address https://deggeh.com in June 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your products Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, StomachAID capsules, and Moringa Tea Bags. We also reviewed your Facebook social media page at https://www.facebook.com/pages/ category /Community/Deggeh-products-Natural-Organic-products-made-in-Gambia-564035160361406/, which directs consumers to your website to purchase your products. The claims on your website, Facebook page, and product labels establish that your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, StomachAID capsules, and Moringa Tea Bags products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Actibest® Health Plus Capsules
Product Label:
“Instant Relief Fortified Herbal Formula for High Blood, Cholesterol, Asthma, Cancer Arthritis, Depression, Migrains [sic], Sickle Cell Kidney Problems Liver Problems . . . Diabetes, Rheumatism, Insomnia, Circulation Problems Hermoroids [sic], Acid reflux, Gastric Ulcers”
Facebook Post dated October 14, 2019:
“Actibest…Fast, Instant relief for: •Diabetes •Blood Pressure…•Hepatitis •Arthritis…•Constipation…•Hemorrhoids…•Migraines…•Cancer •Insomnia •Stroke • Asthma…•Acid Reflux…•Kidney Problems…•Joints, Back Pain”
StomacAID Capsules
Product Label and Image of Product Label on Deggeh Website:
“Prevention and Relief for Gastric Ulcers, Acid Reflux . . . Indigestion . . . Food Poisoning Stomach Worms & Parasites”
Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula
Product Label:
“Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula”
Moringa Tea Bags
Product Label:
“Get almost instant results and relief for: MIGRAINS [sic], HIGHBLOOD [sic] PRESSURE, HIGH SUGAR, DIABETES, HIGH CHOLESTEROL . . . INSOMNIA . . . SICKLE CELL, ASTHMA, RHEUMATISM, ARTHRITIS, LIVER AND KIDNEY DISEASE.”
“SOOTHING MORINGA TEA . . . HELPS PREVENT CANCER, DESTROYS EARLY CANCEROUS CELLS”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, StomachAID capsules, and Moringa Tea Bags are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, StomachAID capsules, and Moringa Tea Bags fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The facility inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Thus, even if your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomachAID capsules products were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act.
The violations include the following:
1. You failed to establish the following specifications as required by 21 CFR 111.70:
Specifications to provide sufficient assurance that the product you receive is adequately identified and is consistent with your purchase order when you receive a product from a supplier for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement (and for distribution rather than for return to the supplier) (21 CFR 111.70(f)).
Specifications for the packaging and labeling of the finished packaged and labeled dietary supplements, including specifications that ensure the specified packaging is used with the specified label (21 CFR 111.70(g)).
Specifically, you did not establish these specifications for your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomachAID capsules dietary supplement products.
We received your March 20, 2022, response. However, you did not provide any of the required specifications noted above.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection, you did not provide any written procedures for quality control operations. We received your March 20, 2022 response, in which you said, “quality control procedures forms now available and will be applied on all future products.” However, your response did not include any written quality control procedures or other evidence of any implemented corrective actions.
During the inspection, you told our investigator that you are President and the most responsible person for Deggeh Foods, Inc. as well as Deggeh Foods International in Gambia, Africa. You also indicated that you make quality decisions and evaluations. You stated that the dietary supplements distributed by Deggeh Foods, Inc. are manufactured at the Gambia, Africa facility of Deggeh Foods International. Our inspection found that such products are packaged and labeled at your Bronx facility of Deggeh Foods, Inc. You also stated that the two firms operate as two separate entities.
To the extent that you contract with other firms to manufacture your product that your firm releases for distribution under your firm’s name, your firm has an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution [72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34790 (Jun. 25, 2007)]. Although a firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations, it cannot contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplement it places into commerce (or causes to be placed into commerce) is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cGMP requirements. In particular, the Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section 402(g) for failure to comply with dietary supplement cGMP requirements (see 21 U.S.C. 342(g) and 331(a)). Thus, a firm that contracts out some or all of its operations must establish a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.55). Quality control personnel must ensure that the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.105). Further, quality control must approve for release, or reject, any packaged and labeled dietary supplement (including a repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement) for distribution, and you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.127(h) and 111.140(b)(2)).
3. You must establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements related to product complaints, as required by 21 CFR 111.553. Although your March 20, 2022 response included written procedures regarding product complaints, your written procedures for product complaints do not include all procedures needed to fulfill the requirements related to the review and investigation of a product complaint.
Specifically, your product complaint procedures lack procedures for a qualified person to review all product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury; and investigate any product complaint that involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of this part, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for packaging and labeling operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.403. Specifically, you did not have written procedures for your packaging and labeling operations. Further, you did not meet the requirements that apply to packaging and labels under 21 CFR 111.410. Specifically, you failed to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.410(d), which provides that you must be able to determine the complete manufacturing history and control of the packaged and labeled dietary supplement through distribution. Although you apply labels to your dietary supplement products, you do not include a lot number or other unique identifier. A lot number or other unique identifier is necessary to determine the complete manufacturing history and control of your dietary supplements.
We received your March 20, 2022, response. Your response did not include evidence of any implemented corrective actions or written procedures for your packaging and labeling operations.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, you did not have written procedures for your holding and distributing operations. In addition, you failed to meet the requirement to hold dietary supplements under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light so that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements are not affected, as required by 21 CFR 111.455(a). Specifically, our investigators noted that you do not monitor the temperature and humidity of the facility, including the warehouse where dietary supplements are stored.
We received your response on March 20, 2022. Your response did not include evidence of any implemented corrective actions or written holding and distributing procedures reportedly now in use.
6. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned dietary supplements, including the procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.503.
We received your response on March 20, 2022, in which you said, “procedures for returned dietary supplements are now established” and included a written document called, “Goods Return Form.” However, this document does not demonstrate that you have taken corrective action to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned dietary supplements. The “Goods Return Form” appears to be a form for customers to fill out when returning goods; it does not include any procedures that you will follow to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.503. For example, the “Goods Return Form” lacks the required procedures to identify and quarantine returned dietary supplements until quality control personnel conducts a material review and makes a disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.503.
Once you have established such written procedures, you must also make and keep records of your compliance with such requirements for returned dietary supplements, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.535(b).
7. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for cleaning the physical plant and grounds and for pest control, as required by 21 CFR 111.16. Specifically, you did not have such written procedures. Once you establish the required procedures, you must make and keep records of such procedures, as required by 21 CFR 111.23(b). Likewise, you failed to establish and follow written procedures for maintaining, cleaning, and sanitizing, as necessary, all equipment, utensils, and any other contact surfaces that are used to package, label, or hold your dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.25(c). For example, you package an allergen, peanut powder, in the same process area used to package your other products, including dietary supplement products, which do not contain peanuts. You were unable to provide cleaning or sanitation procedures or monitoring documents to ensure that there was no cross-contamination with the peanut products. Once you establish the required procedures, you must make and keep records of such procedures, as required by 21 CFR 111.35(b)(1)(iii).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, even if your StomacAID Capsules, Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula products were not unapproved new and misbranded drugs, these products would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your StomacAID Capsules, Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
Your StomacAID capsules product label fails to present the nutrition information in the form of a supplement facts label as required by 21 CFR 101.36.
Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product labels fail to list riboflavin and magnesium in the correct order. Riboflavin should be listed after thiamin and magnesium should be listed after iron in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product labels bear an incorrect %DV for vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, calcium, iron, sodium, and magnesium based on the quantitative amount declared per serving. For dietary ingredients for which DRV's have been established, ""Less than 1%"" or ""<1%"" shall be used to declare the ""% Daily Value"" when the quantitative amount of the dietary ingredient by weight is great enough to require that the dietary ingredient be listed, but the amount is so small that the ""% Daily Value"" when rounded to the nearest percent is zero. Furthermore, the label fails to express each percent DV to the nearest whole percent as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C).
Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product labels bear a symbol beside each (b)(3)-dietary ingredient’s quantitative amount but fail to place the same symbol at the bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement ""Daily Value not established,"" as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv). Furthermore, these labels declare total fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and protein but fail to place a symbol that refers to the statement ""Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet"" at the bottom of the nutrition label, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
2. Your products Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the product labels fail to include an accurate serving size in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b). The “SUPPLEMENT FACTS” label for Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula relays “Serving Size – one tablespoon,” but this product is in capsule form.
3. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to present the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7. The Actibest® Health Plus Capsules label declares the quantity as only “Qty. 30.” The labels must declare the quantity and the units, such as “30 capsules”, presented on the principal display panel.
4. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that these product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically:
These products are encapsulated but the labels fail to declare the capsule ingredients in the ingredients statement. Furthermore, the ingredients statement must be placed below or immediately contiguous and to the right of the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g).
Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules declare moringa, but fails to declare the standardized common name, horseradish tree, that is listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce.
Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules product label declares the ingredient trigonella foenum-graecum, but fails to declare the standardized common name, fenugreek.
5. Your products Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §343(s)(2)(A)] in that their labels fail to list the name of each ingredient of the proprietary blends in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c). Further, your label fails to list the total weight of all dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blends in a Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(3).
6. Your Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (s)(2)(B)] because their labels do not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredients that are in the product, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g). Furthermore, your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules product label fails to present the statement of identity on the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.3(d).
7. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] in that their labels fail to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
8. Your Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the label fails to declare the servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
9. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules, Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula, and StomacAID Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
10. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and StomacAID Capsules products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b). Under section 403(r)(6) of the Act, a dietary supplement may bear certain claims, generally called ""structure/function claims,"" on its label or in its labeling provided that the firm has substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading; the firm has notified FDA within 30 days of marketing the product bearing the claim; and the claim includes a mandatory disclaimer.
11. Your Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because the product label contains information in two languages but does not repeat all the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
Misbranded Conventional Foods
Furthermore, even if your Moringa Tea Bags product was not an unapproved new and misbranded drug, the product would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for conventional foods. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your product Moringa Tea Bags is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] in that the labeling bears nutrient content claims, but the product does not meet the requirements to bear the claims. Your product’s label compares the nutrient content of Moringa Tea Bags to nutrients in other foods:
“15 Times The Potassium Bananas”
“12 Times the Vitamin C in Oranges”
“25 Times The Iron In Spinach”
“17 Times the Calcium in Milk”
“4 Times The Vitamin A In Carrots”
These are considered “relative claims” in that the statements compare the level of a nutrient in the food with the level of a nutrient in a reference food (21 CFR 101.13(j)). When labeling bears a relative claim, the labeling must bear, among other information, clear and concise quantitative information comparing the amount of the subject nutrient in the product per labeled serving with that in the reference food, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.13(j)(2)(iv)(A). Your product makes nutrient content claims that are relative claims, but the labeling fails to bear the quantitative amounts of the subject nutrient in the products in comparison to the reference food.
2. Your product Moringa Tea Bags is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)) since it’s label fails to present nutrition information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9. Specifically, the nutrition information is declared using a Supplement Facts label.
3. Your product Moringa Tea Bags is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size on the label is incorrect. The serving size for tea, flavored and unsweetened, is 12 fl oz (360 mL) as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. The nutritional information for MORINGA TEA BAGS states the serving size as “Serving size 2 Capsules,” but this product is in tea bag form.
4. Your product Moringa Tea Bags is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] because the product label does not include the name and place of business as required by 21 CFR 101.5. The label only bears the web address, phone number, and email address on the principal display panel (PDP).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula products’ Supplement Facts label incorrectly presents protein indented under total carbohydrate and the label fails to indent zeaxanthin and lutein under total carotenoids.
2. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula product labels appear to declare percent DVs based on daily values in use prior to the nutrition labeling regulations which became effective July 26, 2016. The compliance date for the revised labeling regulations was January 1, 2021. When making revisions to your products’ Supplement Facts label, you must comply with the revised labeling regulations.
3. Your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules product label’s information panel includes nutrition and ingredient information intermingled with information that is considered intervening material. Examples of intervening material are the expiration date, structure/function claims, and statements about side effects, chemicals, and additives. All information appearing on the information panel of the product label should appear in one place without other intervening material. [21 CFR 101.2(e)].
4. The placement of heavy bars on your Actibest® Health Plus Capsules and Best Hemorrhoids Rapid Action Herbal Healing Formula products’ Supplement Facts label is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6).
5. The net quantity of contents statement “25 Herbal Tea Bags” is on the information panel of your Moringa Tea Bag product, and not on the principal display panel (PDP) as required by 21 CFR 101.7(a).
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER
July 22, 2022
CMS 627030
Dear Mr. Gillespie:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 1320 Boston Road, Nashport, OH 43830 from December 13-15, 2021 to January 3-4, 2022. Based on the inspectional findings we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page atwww.fda.gov.
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
FDA acknowledges the receipt of your e-mail correspondence dated January 18, 2022, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations:
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:1. You failed to establish an identity specification for any of your components used in the manufacture of dietary supplements as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Specifically, you have not established identity specifications for the ingredient caffeine anhydrous or other ingredients used in the productMuscle Feast MFX Pre Blue Ice Pop. You have also not established identity specifications for the ingredient whey protein isolate or other ingredients used in the productMuscle Feast ISOLATE Whey Protein Mocha Flavor.
2. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, you have not established component specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition for the ingredients: caffeine anhydrous, whey protein isolate, or other ingredients used in the productsMuscle Feast MFX Pre Blue Ice PopandMuscle Feast ISOLATE Whey Protein Mocha Flavor.
We have reviewed your January 18, 2022 response to the form FDA 483 and we note the following. The documents you provided do not establish standards to confirm the identify of the components you use in your dietary supplements. For example, the methods included in your documents are in part using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Identification by HPLC, described in your documents as “positive”, “conforms”, or “meets requirements,” does not indicate what method or reference standard you intend to use to establish the identity of the component. Also, the document you purport to be a specification sheet for Ascorbic Acid identifies “USP 39” as a method. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of this response because it is unclear if “USP 39” is a method that can be used to determine identity of Ascorbic Acid.
3. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you did not establish any product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of your dietary supplement products.
We have reviewed your January 18, 2022 response to the form FDA 483 and we note the following. The documents you provided do not demonstrate that you have established specifications that provide standards to confirm the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of your dietary supplements. For example, visual and organoleptic attributes are indicated to confirm the identity of your finished dietary supplement products, however those attributes are unacceptable to identify powdered products without a complementary identity test that is more specific to the analyte, such as HPLC with an indicated method or reference standard to establish identity. Other attributes indicated are limited to a calculated percentage of protein, fat and moisture content by NIR Spectroscopy, and pH by potentiometric measure. However, none of these attributes provide specific analytical standards to confirm the identity, purity, or strength of your finished products as these characteristics are shared by many of the finished products and would not be sufficient to distinguish them from each other.
Once you have established component specifications and before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). You must also ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
In addition, once you establish finished product specifications, you must verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c).
4. Your quality control personnel failed to approve or reject processes, specifications, written procedures, controls, tests, examinations and deviations or modifications that may affect the identity, purity, strength, or composition of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.105(a). Specifically, your quality control personnel failed to complete quality control (QC) review entries in the calibration logs.
5. Your quality control personnel failed to review and approve all batch production records (BPR), as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(2). Specifically, your quality control personnel failed to review and approve all relevant sections of the batch records for your finished productsMFX Pre Blue Ice Pop, Lot number 280110272113 andCreatine Candy LL, lot number CCLL09272100.
We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action submitted in your January 18, 2022 response for this observation. We note that you provided a copy of a(b)(4)calibration log however, the log has no effective date, and no Quality Assurance approval dates or signatures.
6. You failed to include to include in your BPR complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b). A BPR must include required information described in 21 CFR 111.260. Your BPRs forMFX Pre Blue Ice Pop, Lot number 280110272113,Creatine Candy LL, lot number CCLL09272100, andIsolate Whey Protein, Mocha Flavor, lot number 565312302151, failed to include required information under 21 CFR sections 111.260(b) through (n).
We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action submitted in your January 18, 2022 response for this observation because you did not provide documentation of BPRs for review. We note that you provided 3 blank Master Manufacturing Records (MMRs) and we have the following comment. Batch records are required to accurately follow the appropriate MMR under 21 CFR section 111.255(c). The MMRs you provided are not specific to a product or batch size, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Additionally, the templates do not include all required information of an MMR as required by 21 CFR 111.210 and therefore will not generate batch records that have all the required information under 21 CFR sections 111.260(b) through (n).
7. You failed to hold reserve samples using the same container-closure system in which the packaged and labeled dietary supplement is distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(b)(1). Specifically, during the inspection you stated you collect(b)(4)from each manufactured batch, and it is held in a container-closure system different from that used for the finished packaged and labeled products.
We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action submitted in your January 18, 2022 response for this observation. You stated that you cannot retain reserve samples using the same container-closure system in which the packaged and labeled dietary supplement is distributed due to facility space concerns. We note that if you are distributing a packaged and labeled dietary supplement, 21 CFR 111.83(b)(1) requires you to keep the reserve samples in a container-closure system that is the same as the container-closure system in which the dietary supplement is distributed.

WARNING LETTER
July 8, 2022Dear Mr. Kim:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Custom Research Labs Inc., FEI: 3008268262, at 432 W. Alondra Blvd., Gardena, from June 1 to June 4, 2021.
This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
In addition, “(b)(4),” “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz), and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a), and are misbranded under sections 502(c) and (ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c) and (ee). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a). These violations are described in more detail below.
We reviewed your June 10, 2021, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail.
During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
1. Your firm failed to test samples of each component for identity and conformity with all appropriate written specifications for purity, strength, and quality. Your firm also failed to validate and establish the reliability of your component supplier's test analyses at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and 211.84(d)(2)).
Your firm failed to test incoming active pharmaceutical ingredients (e.g., camphor and menthol) and other components (e.g., deionized (DI) water) used to manufacture over-the-counter drug products to determine their identity, purity, strength, and other appropriate quality attributes. For active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), you relied solely on certificates of analysis (COA) from suppliers where you have not established their reliability. In addition, you have not shown that your water system can consistently produce water suitable for drug manufacturing, and, at a minimum, meets the USP monograph for purified water and appropriate microbial limits.
For example,
Inadequate API Testing
Your firm relied on the COA from unqualified suppliers of camphor and menthol. These components are used in the manufacture of your(b)(4)drug product. The FDA requires identity testing for each component lot used in drug product manufacturing, and you can only rely on the COA for other component attributes by appropriately validating the supplier’s test results at appropriate intervals.
In addition, you did not ensure all specifications of your components were in conformance with USP. For example, the COA specification for impurity testing for halogens of camphor gum USP states “CONFORMS TO USP.” However, the USP monograph for camphor gum has a quantitative acceptance criterion for halogens and the quantitative result was not provided. Also, you provided the COA for menthol USP, which lacked impurity testing data for limit of nonvolatile residue and related compounds as required per the USP monograph.
In your response, you stated that both camphor and menthol have been validated by a third-party laboratory “through assay.” Your response is inadequate because you failed to demonstrate that all appropriate tests for camphor and menthol were performed or that appropriate validation of the supplier’s test results was conducted. Further, you did not address the discrepancies between your third-party laboratory’s COA and USP specifications.
Inadequate Component Water
Your firm has not shown that your DI water is suitable for aqueous-based dosage form drug product manufacturing, and, at a minimum, meets the USP purified water monograph and appropriate microbial limits. Further, your firm lacked sufficient testing of your DI water system. Inadequate water system design is a repeat observation from your 2016 FDA inspection. For example,
• Your firm has no record of testing water for Total Organic Carbon (TOC). In your response you stated, ""All products produced since March 2020, have passed micro testing ensuring there are no TOC issues."" You committed to purchase a TOC meter but failed to provide a timeline for the purchase and validation of the equipment. Further, the vendor stated in the TOC meter proposal provided in your response that, based on the current design of the system, TOC will most likely not meet the specification and that a recirculation pump must be added to keep the TOC low. Your response lacked details on whether you will establish appropriate TOC specifications and ensure your water system is adequately designed to meet those specifications.• Since March 2020, your firm failed to monitor conductivity of your water used as a component in your drug products. You also failed to establish a specification for conductivity. Your response failed to address the lack of a conductivity specification.
Furthermore, your firm’s water system point-of-use ports yielded elevated bioburden counts of 1.3 x 106and 2.3 x 104total plate count (TPC)/ml for water used as a component in your drug products. Your action limit was(b)(4)TPC/ml. Your associated investigations did not adequately determine potential root cause(s) to fully investigate product impact. Your response did not address bioburden failures that lacked adequate investigation. Also, in multiple instances, the pH of your water system Line(b)(4)was out of specification with results ranging between 3.59 and 4.73. Your pH specification was(b)(4). In your response, you stated that, batches manufactured during this period were reviewed and there was no evidence that batches were affected. However, you did not provide data to substantiate this claim.
Without routine water monitoring of an appropriately designed system, you cannot ensure that your water meets minimum microbiological and chemical standards suitable for the manufacture of your drug products.
In response to this letter, provide:
• A description of how you will test each component lot for conformity with all appropriate specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity. If you intend to accept any results from your supplier’s COA instead of testing each component lot for strength, quality, and purity, specify how you will robustly establish the reliability of your supplier’s results through initial validation as well as periodic re-validation. In addition, include a commitment to always conduct at least one specific identity test for each incoming component lot.
• The chemical and microbiological quality control specifications you use to test and release each incoming lot of component for use in manufacturing.
• A comprehensive, independent review of your material system to determine whether all suppliers of components, containers, and closures, are each qualified and the materials are assigned appropriate expiration or retest dates. The review should also determine whether incoming material controls are adequate to prevent use of unsuitable components, containers, and closures.
• A procedure for your water system monitoring that specifies routine chemical and microbial testing of water to ensure its acceptability for use in each batch of drug products produced by your firm.
• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your water system design and maintenance including the sanitization process. In addition, provide a summary of the qualification protocol(s) for your component water system. Also, include a summary of any improvements made to your system design and program for routine control and maintenance.
2. Your firm failed to establish adequate written procedures for production and process control designed to assure that the drug products you manufacture have the identity, strength, quality, and purity they purport or are represented to possess (21 CFR 211.100(a)).
Your firm failed to validate the manufacturing process for(b)(4)drug product currently in distribution. This is a repeat observation from your 2016 FDA inspection.
In your response, you stated that the validation of your(b)(4)drug product was not completed yet because you “require(b)(4)batches before we can validate a formula,” and only two batches have been completed. However, as observed during the inspection, there are at least(b)(4)batches manufactured using an unvalidated process and currently in distribution. Your response is inadequate because you failed to conduct an assessment or identify corrective actions to address unvalidated drug products currently in distribution.
In response to this letter, provide:
• A detailed summary of your validation program for ensuring a state of control throughout the product lifecycle, along with associated procedures. Describe your program for process performance qualification, and ongoing monitoring of both intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure a continuing state of control.
• A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification for each of your marketed drug products, including how you will ensure proper validation prior to distribution of drugs.
3. Your firm failed to establish and follow an adequate written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)).
Your firm lacked stability data to support the expiration dates for your(b)(4)drug product which is currently in distribution. This is a repeat observation from your 2016 FDA inspection. Instead, to support the two-year expiration date of your drug product, you provided data from a different formulation of(b)(4)that failed its long-term stability study and was stopped at the three-month time point because of changes in viscosity. The long-term stability test report determined the need for reformulation.
In your response, you explained that because a retain sample of(b)(4)drug product passed microbiology and assay testing, the two-year expiration date was justified for the drug product. However, the retain sample tested was the formulation that failed its long-term stability study for viscosity. Further, you did not provide testing to ensure the retain sample met all specifications required during your stability studies such as odor, pH, and viscosity. Your response is inadequate because you failed to provide a report that ensures adequate stability studies have been conducted for all drug products.
Without an adequate stability program, you cannot confirm that your drug products will meet established specifications and all pre-determined quality criteria throughout their shelf life.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
• A comprehensive, independent assessment and corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:o Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permitted.o Stability-indicating methods.o An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if the shelf-life claim remains valid.o Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint).
• All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program.
4. Your firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).
Your quality unit (QU) failed to review batch records before releasing drug product for distribution. Your QU procedure specifies that the Quality Assurance designee is responsible for reviewing all manufacturing, production, and quality records. However, during the inspection, one of your QU employees stated that the shipping and production department had released drug product batches before the batch record had been reviewed by the QU. It was also stated that your firm is trying to catch up on back logged batch record reviews. During the inspection, we observed that drug product batch records were incomplete at the time of release for(b)(4)Lot(b)(4), and(b)(4)and for(b)(4)Lot(b)(4).
In your response, you stated that all pending batch record reviews have been completed and that you revised your record review procedure to include batch sheet approval and other controls. However, your response failed to provide details of the outcome of that review. Your response is inadequate because you failed to identify appropriate corrective actions when the QU released drug products before batch record completion to ensure that drug products met established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity.
Your response demonstrated a lack of CGMP understanding and the lack of adequate quality oversight and control from incoming products to finished product.
Your inspectional history indicates that your quality unit is not fully exercising its authority and responsibilities. Your firm must provide the QU with the appropriate authority and sufficient resources to carry out its responsibilities and consistently ensure drug quality.
In response to this letter, provide:
• A comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to:o A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriateo Provisions for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practiceso A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decisiono Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products
Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Violations
Unapproved New Drug Violations
“(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz), and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21, U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4)are topical products intended for use as external analgesics. “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are topical products intended for use as consumer topical antiseptics. Examples of claims from the products’ labeling, including websites listed on product labels, that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined by 21 CFR 201.128) of these products include, but may not be limited to, the following: From your website(b)(4):
On your website homepage:(b)(4)
On your website for “HOW IT WORKS”:(b)(4)
“(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz)“Easy To Use Spray + Surface Disinfectant . . .Uses1● for handwashing to decrease microbial contamination on the skin ● may be reapplied during the day as required ● for disinfecting surfaces” [from your product label]
“BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer”“Lavender Oil . . . Rosemary Leaf Oil . . . Geranium Flower Oil . . . Antimicrobial Properties . . .UsesTo decrease bacteria on the skin ▪ Recommended for repeated use” [from your product label]“Made in CaliforniafromEthically Sourced Cosmetic Grade Ingredients with Antimicrobial Properties : . . . ● Aloe Vera . . . ● Lavender Oil . . . ● Rosemary Leaf Oil . . . ● Geranium Flower Oil . . . ●Specially Denatured Alcohol 70% vv” ” (from(b)(4))
As described below, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz), and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. New drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products, as further described below) or under other exceptions not applicable here. No FDA-approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, are in effect for these drug products, nor are we aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz), and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” drug products are GRASE for use under the conditions suggested, recommended, or prescribed in their labeling. Accordingly, these drug products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
External Analgesic Drug Products
“(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” are topical external analgesic drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h(a)(1), category I drugs that were subject to a tentative final monograph (TFM) that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination for such drug issued under 21 CFR Part 330 are deemed to be GRASE and not “new drugs,” as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM and comply with all other applicable requirements. We note that over-the-counter (OTC) topical external analgesic products were addressed in the TFM for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983) and subsequent rulemakings. Under 505G(b)(8) of the FD&C Act, the 1983 external analgesic TFM, in combination with subsequent rulemakings, was deemed to be a final administrative order. However, “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4)” do not conform to the conditions of use specified in the final administrative order for the reasons described below.
The active ingredients, in your products, “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4),” i.e.,(b)(4), and(b)(4), are not active ingredients included in the final administrative order for topical external analgesics. Although the product labeling does not specifically list these ingredients as active ingredients, the website claims for these ingredients, such as “With(b)(4), and(b)(4)temporarily reduces inflammation and pain,” “(b)(4)Used in homeopathic medicine as a treatment for bruises, sprains, pains, and other wounds,” “(b)(4)Alternative pain relief method applied to the skin for relief from sore muscles, aching joints, pain or inflammation” and “(b)(4)Natural pain reliever that can stimulate circulation to promote healing,” demonstrate that these are each an “active ingredient” as defined in 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) because each ingredient is intended to furnish pharmacological activity.2
Furthermore, your “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” products fall under section 505G(a)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 USC 355h(a)(5)), because the FDA has determined that counterirritant external analgesic drug products with the active ingredient eucalyptus oil are not GRASE under a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330.3Therefore, these products are new drugs under FD&C Act 201(p).
Your “(b)(4)” is labeled for use as a counterirritant drug product because it includes claims associated with muscular aches and pains. The labeled active ingredient,(b)(4), falls below the allowable dosage range of 3% -11% for this active ingredient when used as a counterirritant in the 1983 TFM (48 FR 5862 at 5868).4Further, the product labeling for “(b)(4)” includes the claim of fibromyalgia pain as an indication, which is not an indication that is permitted consistent with the conditions of marketing under the topical external analgesic final administrative order. This labeled intended use goes beyond merely describing the general intended use for external analgesic products as set forth in the final administrative order.
In addition, the FDA is not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4)” drug products are GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).
Topical Antiseptic Drug Products
Based on the above labeling claims, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are topical products intended for use as topical antiseptic drug products. As described below, these topical antiseptic drug products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
We note that over-the-counter (OTC) topical antiseptic products had been the subject of rulemaking under the Agency’s OTC Drug Review. In particular, such products were addressed in a tentative final monograph (TFM) entitled “Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products,” Proposed Rule, 59 FR 31402 (June 17, 1994) (1994 TFM), as further amended by “Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Proposed Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph; Reopening of Administrative Record,” Proposed Rule, 81 FR 42912 (June 30, 2016) (Consumer Antiseptic -Rubs Proposed Rule). Over the course of these rulemakings, three active ingredients (benzalkonium chloride, ethyl alcohol (ethanol), and isopropyl alcohol) were classified as Category III for use in consumer antiseptic rub products, meaning that additional safety and effectiveness data are needed to support a determination that a drug product containing one of these active ingredients would be GRASE for use in a consumer antiseptic rub. Additionally, OTC consumer antiseptic washes were addressed in “Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,” Proposed Rule, 78 FR 76444 (December 17, 2013) (Consumer Antiseptic Washes Proposed Rule) and “OTC Safety and Effectiveness of Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use,” Final Rule, 81 FR 61106 (September 6, 2016). We note that ethyl alcohol is not one of the active ingredients that was classified as Category III for use as an active ingredient in a consumer antiseptic wash. Under the Consumer Antiseptic Washes rulemaking, ethyl alcohol was determined to be ineligible for evaluation under the OTC Drug Review for use as an active ingredient in consumer antiseptic washes.
Section 505G of the FD&C Act addresses nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as Category III for safety or effectiveness in a TFM that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination for such drug issued under 21 CFR Part 330 – and that were not classified as Category II for safety or effectiveness – are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM, including the active ingredient, and comply with all other applicable requirements.
However, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” do not conform to the 1994 TFM, as further amended by the 2016 Consumer Antiseptic Rubs Proposed Rule and the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Washes Proposed Rule, nor any other TFM, proposed rule or final rule. Thus, neither “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) nor “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” meets the conditions under section 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act for marketing without an approved application under section 505.
As previously noted, statements on the “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) label suggest both that the product is a consumer antiseptic wash and a consumer antiseptic rub. However, ethyl alcohol (in any concentration) is not an active ingredient permitted for use in a consumer antiseptic hand wash under the 2013 Consumer Antiseptic Washes Proposed Rule as further amended in the 2016 Final Rule.
In addition, Lavender Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, and Geranium Flower Oil are clearly represented as active ingredients in the labeling of your “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” drug product.5Specifically, your product labeling for “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” features on the Principal Display Panel (PDP) “Lavender Oil . . . Rosemary Leaf Oil . . . Geranium Flower Oil . . . Antimicrobial Properties.” Your labeling further emphasizes these ingredients are intended to have a therapeutic effect with the statements “Our Hand Sanitizer with Antimicrobial Properties is carefully formulated with natural and botanical non-toxic ingredients that moisturize and are gentle for the skin, but 99% effective against germs.” As noted above, Lavender Oil, Rosemary Leaf Oil, and Geranium Flower Oil are not active ingredients in any applicable final monograph or TFM for purposes of establishing eligibility for lawful marketing without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Therefore, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” do not conform with the TFM, or the applicable requirements.
We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” drug products are GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a).
Misbranded Drug Violations
In addition, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz) is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 352(c), because the product’s Drug Facts panel contains extraneous information that goes beyond the required directions described in the rulemakings mentioned above. Specifically, 21 CFR 201.66(d)(7) states that additional information not described in the content requirements for OTC drug products should not appear in the Drug Facts panel. However, the Uses section for your product’s Drug Facts panel includes language such as “for disinfecting surfaces” that is not consistent with the uses provided for in the applicable rulemakings for consumer antiseptic rubs and consumer antiseptic washes.
Further, “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” (8 oz and 16 oz), and “BAK-OFF Instant Hand Sanitizer” are misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21U.S.C. 352(ee), because they are nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section, and are not the subjects of applications approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.
Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
Quality Systems
Your firm’s quality systems are inadequate. See the FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 athttps://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/quality-systems-approach-pharmaceutical-current-good-manufacturing-practice-regulations.
CGMP Consultant Recommended
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.
Additionally, we note that you manufacture several OTC drug products, “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” that are labeled with a Drug Facts panel in which the purpose identifies these products as a “Pain Reliever.” While we acknowledge that neither product currently appears to be available for purchase or distribution in the US, we want to advise you of their regulatory status under 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355G. “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4)” are considered to be drugs as defined under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C) because they are intended for use as external analgesics. Section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. These products prominently feature cannabidiol (CBD) on the principal display panel and include statements such as, “(b)(4)CBD.” Although CBD is labeled as an inactive ingredient in the labels of “(b)(4)” and “(b)(4),” the labeling for these products clearly represents CBD as an active ingredient.6Currently, a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not generally recognized as safe and effective and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed.
Furthermore, even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements for nonprescription drug products under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, such product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e)7. Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effect8and must be safe when used at the intended dosage.9
We note that CBD also cannot legally be sold in a conventional food or dietary supplement product. Please see the following for more information:FDA Regulation of Cannabis and Cannabis-Derived Products, Including Cannabidiol (CBD) and Warning Letters and Test Results for Cannabidiol-Related Products.

1We note that your “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER” labeling contains conflicting information about whether it should be used as a consumer antiseptic rub/consumer antiseptic wash or consumer antiseptic rub. The term “hand sanitizer” generally refers to consumer antiseptic rubs and the Drug Facts labeling of your product both indicates that the product is to be used for handwashing (presumably with water) and suggests that it should be used without water (i.e., “wet hands thoroughly with product” followed by the statement “briskly rub hands together until dry.” “(b)(4)HAND SANITIZER,” however, does not conform to the requirements for either a consumer antiseptic rub or a consumer antiseptic wash as discussed in this letter.
2Under 21 CFR 201.66(b), an active ingredient is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.
3On November 7, 1990, FDA issued a final rule establishing that OTC counterirritant external analgesic drug products containing certain active ingredients, including eucalyptus oil, are not generally recognized as safe and effective. 55 FR 46920. FDA’s final determination was codified in regulations at 21 CFR 310.545(a)(10)(ii). Under section 505G(k)(2)(A) of the FD&C Act, the non-monograph conditions in 21 CFR 310.545 in effect on the day before the date of enactment of the CARES Act (i.e., March 26, 2020) were deemed to be a final administrative order. The final administrative order is entitled “Non-Monograph Conditions NM900: Drug Products Containing Certain Active Ingredients Offered Over-the-Counter for Certain Uses” (See Order ID OTC 000007, available atOTC Monographs@FDA,https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/omuf/).
4As noted earlier, the 1983 external analgesic TFM, in combination with subsequent determinations, was deemed to be a final administrative order under 505G(b)(8) of the FD&C Act.
5Under 21 CFR 201.66(b), an active ingredient is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.
6See Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983). CBD was not included as an active ingredient under this TFM. Under 21 CFR 201.66(b), an active ingredient is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.
721 CFR 330.1(e) requires that “the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity.”
8See e.g., 21 CFR 314.3(b) and 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), which define an active ingredient as “any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man.” All other components of a finished drug product are considered inactive ingredients (see 21 CFR 314.3(b), 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8)).

RE: CMS#626254
WARNING LETTER
Dear Ms. Salvadori:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your dietary supplement and cosmetics manufacturing and distributing facility located at 215 Linda Vista Drive, Hendersonville, NC from October 28-29, 2021, during which we collected product labels and brochures. We also reviewed your website at the Internet address www.mynewsun.com in May 2022, and have determined that you take orders there for the products Advanced Liver Plus, Advanced U-Tract, Bilberry Eyebright, Calcium Magnesium Liquid, Elderberry Plus Vitamin C, Lymphatic Cleanser, NKC, Para-CL, Yew/Olive Combination, Kidz DHA, and Kidz Super Dophilus, as well as the products Ultra CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), CBD Gummies, and Advanced CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD) (hereinafter referred to as “New Sun products”). The claims on your website and on other product labeling establish that your New Sun products are drugs under section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
As explained further below, introducing, or delivering these products for introduction, into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
The Agency is particularly concerned that you market one of your unapproved new drug products as safe for children. Your product webpage for Advanced CBD Oil (Hemp Oil) states that “Hemp Seed Oil (CBD) is a dietary supplement, and is safe to be consumed on a daily basis by adults as well as children.” Your product has not been evaluated by the Agency for safety, effectiveness, and quality. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations. For example, children may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at www.mynewsun.com indicates you intend to market your Ultra CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), CBD Gummies, and Advanced CBD Oil (Hemp Oil) products as dietary supplements. Specifically, the product webpages display images of the product labels with a supplement facts panel. However, your CBD products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)]. Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 355] or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.1There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and product labeling (brochures), your New Sun products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
Examples of some of the website and product labeling claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:

They may also prevent secondary infections and diarrhea in kids using antibiotics. Probiotics may even help prevent eczema and allergies in some children.”
Your above New Sun products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Advanced Liver Plus, Advanced U-Tract, Calcium Magnesium Liquid, Lymphatic Cleanser, Ultra CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), CBD Gummies, Advanced CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), NKC, and Kidz DHA products are intended for the treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Advanced Liver Plus, Advanced U-Tract, Calcium Magnesium Liquid, Lymphatic Cleanser, Ultra CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), CBD Gummies, Advanced CBD Oil (Hemp Oil), NKC, and Kidz DHA fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, we offer the following comment: We note that your website includes the statement that “New Sun Hemp Classic CBD Oil and Advanced Hemp CBD Oil are made . . . in an FDA approved facility.” Although certain facilities must register with FDA, FDA does not approve facilities.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Victoria Palmer, Compliance Officer, 60 8th Street, N.E. Atlanta, GA 30309 or via email at Victoria.palmer@fda.hhs.gov (preferred). If you have questions regarding the content of this letter you may contact Victoria L.

1CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the Act.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Curtis:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.livingfoodsusa.com in March 2022 and has determined you take orders for the products Bion+Plus Silver Ozone and ZeoHeal the Miracle Mineral Supplement. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
We have also determined that your firm is marketing the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna in the United States without marketing clearance or approval, in violation of the Act. Under section 201(h) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h), this product is a device because it is intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs
Your Bion+Plus Silver Ozone and ZeoHeal The Miracle Mineral products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA as described in Sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Examples of some of the claims observed on the website www.livingfoodsusa.com that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include: https://www.livingfoodusa.com/Articles.asp?ID-262 and https://www.livingfoodsusa.com/Bion-Plus-SS-p/bion.htm
Bion +Plus Silver Ozone
“Bonding ozone to silver rather than O2 or O4, enables BION PLUS to duplicate the action of immune cells that make ozone to fight pathogens.”
“The molecule therefore at any chance will continue to naturally attract negatively charged electrons found in scavenging, hostile organisms, e.g., hostile, gram-negative bacteria, viruses, molds, etc., have one electron (-1) in their molecular makeup. They are therefore attracted to the Bion Plus molecules and self-destruct once they contact the Bion Plus molecules because the hostile, gram-negative release the electron from themselves, thus changing their polarity and they self-destruct in the process.”
“It is important to note that Bion Plus is not an anti-microbial product. It simply supplies unique dietary supplementation to the body in such a manner that the hostile microbes eliminate themselves naturally in the absence of a polluted, unhealthy body and the presence of a nonpolluted, healthy body containing clean and healthy water that is filled with natural elements that are uniquely designed for optimum health.”
Bion +Plus testimonials indicating how product is used
“I am a 64 year old woman and my doctor told me my immune system is compromised. However, I have gotten hit with a bug this season twice and both times I took the Bion+Plus Covalent Silver. I knocked it out in the same day with just a couple teaspoons each time. Meanwhile, all my friends have gotten the same bug and they are still battling it. This Bion+ Plus really works! Better than any other I’ve tried. I love that Bion+Plus Covalent Silver is noncolloidal and safe to use. I wouldn’t be without it. I always keep a bottle on hand.” https://wwwlivingfoodusa.com/Articles.asp?ID=258 and https://www.livingfoodsusa.com/zeohealp/zeo.htm
ZeoHeal The Miracle Mineral Supplement
“Zeolite cage can easily trap varieties of articles, working hierarchically as the article below describes: heavy metals first, then toxic chemicals, plastics, and viruses. The mineral detoxifier removes the metals and toxic molecules from the body”
“Zeolite traps and nullifies nitrosamines in the digestive track. Nitrosamines are cancer-causing agents”
“Nitrosamines are a causative factor in type-II diabetes.”
“Zeoheal *** theultimate heavy metal detoxifierwith a unique zeolite-fulvic acid compoundfor effective and safe deep tissue cleanse of all contaminates”
“Metal Chelator/Chlathrator Toxic Chemical Eliminator”
“Taking ZeoHeal and Bion 3x a day with much improved gut and other symptoms related to ovarian cyst removal”
“Traps and Neutralizes carcinogenic Nitrosamines”
“Exhibits broad spectrum anti-viral activity”
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your ZeoHeal The Miracle Mineral product is intended for prevention of one or more diseases that are not amenable to prevention by consumers themselves without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your ZeoHeal The Miracle Mineral fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Unapproved Medical Device
As stated above, the FDA has determined that your firm is marketing the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna in the United States without marketing clearance or approval, in violation of the Act.
FDA has reviewed your website, https://www.livingfoodsusa.com/, and determined that the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g) for the device as described and marketed. The Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna is also misbranded under section 502(o) the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), because your firm introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce for commercial distribution this device with major changes or modifications to the intended use without submitting a new premarket notification to FDA as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), and 21 CFR 807.81(a)(3)(ii). For a device requiring premarket approval, the notification required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k), is deemed satisfied when a PMA is pending before the agency. 21 CFR 807.81(b).
Specifically, the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna was cleared in K053376 as an infrared lamp under 21 CFR 890.5500 with the following indications for use:
“The device may be used for the temporary relief of minor muscle and joint pain and stiffness, the temporary relief of joint pain associated with arthritis, the temporary increase in local circulation where applied, and relaxation of muscles. In addition, the lamp may also help muscle spasms, minor sprains and strains, and minor muscular back pain.”
Generic devices under 21 CFR 890.5500 are intended for medical purposes that emit energy at infrared frequencies (approximately 700 nanometers to 50,000 nanometers) to provide topical heating. Devices, when classified under 21 CFR 890.5500 as an infrared therapeutic heating lamp, are exempt from premarket notification, subject to 21 CFR 890.9.
However, your firm’s website includes statements describing uses of the device for several treatments and therapies for additional medical conditions, which would constitute one or more major changes or modifications to its cleared intended use and for which your firm lacks clearance or approval. Furthermore, the uses you describe differ from the classification codified at 21 CFR 890.5500, such that premarket notification is required prior to introduction or delivery for introduction of this device into interstate commerce for commercial distribution. 21 CFR 882.9.
Examples of such statements include but are not limited to:
Cancer treatment claims -
o “Cancer patients must seek proper medical treatment. However, it is likely that medical treatment will prove more beneficial if you use the Relax FIR Sauna to improve your basic health. (2) Increased oxygen flow helps increase the growth of normal cells around the cancerous area. This is beneficial as it prohibits the spreading of cancer cells. The Relax FIR Sauna enhances oxygen delivery in the body including to the cancerous areas. Coupled with medical treatment, health improvement can be experienced.”
Kidney function medical claims -
o “The Relax FIR Sauna also improves capillary circulation, and removes excess toxins from the body thereby reducing the burden on the kidneys, helping to prevent kidney failure”
o “The Relax FIR Sauna supports kidney function by increasing excretion of uric acid, urea and toxins through your perspiration.”
o “(Remove Toxins) – Metabolism Waste – Dioxins – Cadmium & Hg – HeavyMetals – Fats”
Cardiovascular disease treatment claims –
o “The FIR Sauna effectively reduces the risk of chronic illnesses such as high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes.”
o “FIR supports prevention of vascular sclerosis (hardening of blood vessels). Incidence of cardiovascular disease(s) will thus also decrease.”
o “People with conditions such as heart diseases and high blood pressure show marked improvement after using Relax FIR Sauna because FIR energy helps dilate their blood vessels and increase blood flow thereby unblocking and eliminating waste in the blood vessels.”
o “Relax FIR Sauna provides FIR energy, which helps reduce the size of water molecule clusters and decreases the possibility of blood coagulation; thus blood flow is smooth. Long-term usage can help to reduce the problems of viscous blood.”
Vasodilation and increased blood oxygen claims –
o “Regular use of the Relax FIR Sauna improves blood circulation by vasodilation (expansion of blood vessels) and reduces the size of water molecule clusters (more than 90% of blood plasma is water). Deep, slow and long breathing during sauna sessions will also help to increase oxygen in the blood.”
o “Relax FIR Sauna increases blood flow and dilates blood vessels. It also helps retain the elasticity of blood vessels and helps them to ’exercise’.”
o “FIR energy improves blood circulation and efficient nutrient and oxygen delivery. FIR thus promotes cell growth and cell reactivation, overcoming and preventing growth of abnormal cells, and supports good cellular maintenance.”
Chronic illnesses treatment claims -
o “Relax FIR Sauna can play a pivotal role in disease prevention and in health maintenance by activating the body to relieve degenerative disease and to avoid the fall into chronic disease.”o “FIR absorption promotes elimination of body toxins and helps eliminate chronic illnesses.”
Dermatological condition treatment claims -
o “FIR promotes healing of acne, eczema, psoriasis, burns, skin lesions and cuts. Open wounds heal more rapidly with reduced scarring. FIR firms the skin, improving tone, texture and elasticity.”
o “The dilation of blood vessels helps in improving blood circulation and promotes elimination of toxins. Cells can also better receive and absorb nutrition; muscles and the skin regain their elasticity. Wrinkles are prevented and the skin becomes more lustrous.”
Based on the information reviewed by FDA, Living Foods’s marketing of the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna with the above claims, which have not been cleared or approved, raise misbranding and adulteration concerns as noted above.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, we offer the following comment:
We note that we are unable to identify whether the device covered by the above-referenced 510(k) clearance is the same as the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna your firm is currently marketing. We request that you provide to us in writing with your firm’s basis for determining the Relax Far Infrared Ray Sauna is the same device described in K053376.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 8050 Marshall Drive, Suite 205, Lenexa, Kansas 66214, to the attention of Kara L. Roden, Compliance Officer. If you should have any questions regarding any issue in this letter, please contact Kara L. Roden, at 913-495-5121 or via email at Kara.Roden@fda.hhs.gov.

RE: 623359
Dear Mr. Gaafar,
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained samples of your products Etumax Royal Honey for Him, Dose Vital Honey for Men, and Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her, purchased directly from your websites www.thirstyrun.com and www.usroyalhoney.com. FDA also reviewed your websites in June 2022. Based on our review of your websites and laboratory analysis of your products, FDA has identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
Prohibited Act under Section 301(ll)
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that samples of your products, Etumax Royal Honey for Him and Dose Vital Honey for Men, contain the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient tadalafil, and your product, Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her, contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient sildenafil, both of which are phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitors. Tadalafil and sildenafil are the active ingredients in the FDA-approved prescription drugs Cialis and Viagra, respectively, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). These undeclared ingredients may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.Subject to a limited exception, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(II)] to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355] or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to sildenafil and tadalafil.1FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which sildenafil or tadalafil has been added. Your Etumax Royal Honey for Him, Dose Vital Honey for Men, and Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her products are foods to which sildenafil or tadalafil has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(II) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
FDA reviewed your websites at www.thirstyrun.com and www.usroyalhoney.com in June 2022 and determined you take orders there for the products Etumax Royal Honey for Him, Dose Vital Honey for Men, and Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her. In addition to being foods of which the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Etumax Royal Honey for Him and Dose Vital Honey for Men products:
“Reproductive System Health - Being a product of nature, royal honey possesses nutrients that decrease the risk of prostate illness and other reproductive system conditions.”
Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her product:
“Reduces vaginal discharge and protects against bacterial infection”
Your Etumax Royal Honey for Him, Dose Vital Honey for Men, and Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
You market Secret Miracle Royal Honey for Her as a dietary supplement. For example, the webpages for this product on your websites display a product label image with “dietary supplement” on them. However, this product cannot be a dietary supplement because it does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that sildenafil products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)]. Under those provisions, if an article (such as sildenafil) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 355], or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for sildenafil. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that sildenafil products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Additionally, we have the following comments:
Your websites www.thirstyrun.com and www.usroyalhoney.com offer the product Pink Pussycat for Her for sale to consumers in the United States. Previous FDA laboratory analyses confirmed that Pink Pussycat contains the undeclared ingredient sildenafil (December 8, 2021 Public Notification: Pink Pussycat contains hidden drug ingredient,https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/public-notification-pink-pussycat-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient). While the Agency has not tested and sampled the above-mentioned product from your inventory since issuance of this public notification, this letter is to express our serious concern about the safety of this product and emphasize that it is your legal responsibility under federal law to ensure that it does not contain any undeclared and potentially harmful ingredients.
FDA has not conducted a complete review of your inventory. It is your responsibility under the FD&C Act to ensure that products marketed by your firm do not contain undeclared ingredients and comply with all requirements of federal law. A full list of all tainted products discovered by FDA can be found athttp://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/sda/sdNavigation.cfm?sd=tainted_supplements_cder. We recommend that you subscribe to our email service athttps://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USFDA/subscriber/newto receive regular notices about tainted products discovered by FDA.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete all corrections within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply to the above violations should be directed to Mr. Quyen Tien with the FDA via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.

RE: 627006
Dear Mr. Lawson,
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) obtained samples of your product X RATED HONEY FOR MEN, purchased directly from your website www.pleasureproductsusa.com. FDA also reviewed your website in June 2022. Based on our review of your website and laboratory analysis of your product, FDA has identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act).
Prohibited Act under Section 301(ll)
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that samples of your X RATED HONEY FOR MEN contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient tadalafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Tadalafil is the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Cialis, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.
Subject to a limited exception, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(ll)] to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355] or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to tadalafil.1FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which tadalafil has been added.
Your X RATED HONEY FOR MEN product is a food to which tadalafil has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
You market X RATED HONEY FOR MEN as a dietary supplement. For example, the product webpage describes the product as a supplement and displays a product label image with “Supplement Facts.” However, this product cannot be dietary supplement because it does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that tadalafil products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)]. Under those provisions, if an article (such as tadalafil) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 355], or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.

May 26, 2022
22-HAFE4-WL-05/CMS No. 625783Dear Mr. Loff:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 2375 Saint Johns Bluff Rd S Ste 310, Jacksonville, Florida, on November 1, 2, 3 and 10, 2021. Based on our inspection and our review of labeling collected during the inspection, we identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You may find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
During the inspection, our investigators reviewed your product labels and your website at www.doctorsoptimalformula.com, from which website you take orders for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule, and Alereve Seasonal Allergy Support Ocular Health Capsule. The claims on your product labels and website establish that the products are drugs within the meaning of section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your product labels and website that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Product: DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsul
On your product label:“Take if suffering from glaucoma or ocular hypertension”“Reduces IOP & Increases Blood Flow”“DoctoRX’s formula”
On your website:“Our ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula was designed specifically for patients suffering from glaucoma, ocular hypertension, or those with a strong family history of glaucoma.”“MitrogenolTM is clinically proven to reduce intraocular pressure by up to 25% without the side effects.”
Product: DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule
On your product label:“Reduces risks of photochemical damage from effects of Blue Light”“DoctoRX’s formula”
On your website:“This constant bombardment from cell phones, tablets, computers, televisions, etc. poses a particular threat to those either suffering from or with a predisposition to Macular Degeneration.”“For those with genetic predisposition to AMD [Age-Related Macular Degeneration], and in addition with a history of smoking, family history of AMD, or lightly-colored eyes should vigorously protect themselves from the risks associated with screen addiction and blue light. Meso Plus Astaxanthin contains the essential nutrients necessary, and should be included in the diet for those susceptible”
Product: Alereve Seasonal Allergy Ocular Support Capsule
On Product label:“Relief from symptoms associated with ocular allergies and sinus pressure”“Relief from Symptom of OSD [Ocular Surface Disease] *Without the Side Effects of Antihistamines”
On your website:“Developed by leading Ophthalmologists specializing in allergies, Alereve has developed an all-natural, proprietary blend that is positioned to be the therapy of choice for patients with ocular allergies, treating the patient’s underlying allergic condition without the unwanted side-effects of dryness.”“Alereve was developed to better treat patients’ ocular allergies without exacerbating their dry eye component in fact, our initial study demonstrated that some patient’s Dry Eye Syndrome was significantly improved with Alereve treatment”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legallyintroduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule and DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule and DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement cGMP Violations
During the inspection, our investigators found significant violations of the current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations for dietary supplements, Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations render dietary supplements manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet cGMP regulations for dietary supplements. Additionally, even if your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule, and Alereve Seasonal Allergy Support Ocular Health Capsule were not unapproved new and/or misbranded drugs as described previously in this letter, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements. Our investigators’ observations were noted on form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on November 10, 2021, and amended on November 16, 2021.
Our investigators identified the following significant violations:
1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminants that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have no such specifications for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Dry Eye Formula Ocular Support Softgel, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule, and Alereve Seasonal Allergy Support Ocular Health Capsule.
We have reviewed your response, dated November 29, 2021. Your response included a finished product specification sheet for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule product titled “Specifications Document #: GLSOP-400 Revision 4 Effective date Jan 14 2021,” a finished product specification monitoring form that did not identify the intended product or intended testing, and an Excel spreadsheet that you assert demonstrates training was performed related to specifications. The finished product sheet for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule product did not contain specifications for strength, concentration, or purity. It also lists a specification of “Positive” for the(b)(4)((b)(4)) method. Positive is not a viable specification for the use of the(b)(4)method. In addition, you list “Input” for the method regarding several of the dietary ingredients in this product. Input is not an acceptable method for determining finished product specifications have been met.
2. You failed to establish the component specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition for the dietary supplements are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, you failed to establish component specifications for the components Grape Seed Extract Blackcurrant “Fuit [sic]” Powder (Blackcurrant Fruit Powder), Curcumin 95%, Astaxanthin 5%, and Meso-Zeaxanthin 60% used in the manufacture of your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule, and Alereve Seasonal Allergy Support Ocular Health Capsule.
Once you have established these specifications, you must determine whether the specifications that you establish under 21 CFR 111.70 are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Further, you must verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, composition, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or that lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). You must also make and keep records, including records for the specifications you establish, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We have reviewed your response, dated November 29, 2021. Your response stated you are developing component specifications but did not provide any evidence of this corrective action.
3. Your batch production records (BPRs) did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your BPRs for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Ocular Pressure & Optic Nerve Support Formula Ocular Health Capsule, DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule, and Alereve Seasonal Allergy Support Ocular Health Capsule failed to include the following information:
Documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch [111.260(l)(3)].
Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the date on which each step of the master manufacturing record was performed and the initials of the persons performing each step, including the initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch, the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure of each component used in the batch, the initials of the person responsible for adding the component to the batch, and the initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)].
We have reviewed your response, dated November 29, 2021. Your response included a procedure for maintaining of BPRs as well as two parts of an executed BPR for your DoctoRx’s Optimal Formula Meso Plus Astaxanthin Ocular Support Capsule product for a batch size of 50,000. Your response also stated that “[t]he anticipated completion date for this corrective action December 31, 2022.” Based on the incomplete BPRs provided we are unable to evaluate the sufficiency of your corrective action.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also note that your product Hourzzz Sublingual Drops, which is marketed as a dietary supplement, bears directions for use as a sublingual product. However, the Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)] as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Because sublingual products are intended to enter the body directly through the skin or mucosal tissues, they are not dietary supplements.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be directed to the Food and Drug Administration, attention to: Mr. Ramon Hernández, District Director, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact, Ms. Marilyn Santiago, Compliance Officer, at (787) 729-8707 or via email at Marilyn.santiago@fda.hhs.gov.

May 26, 2022
RE: 623509
Dear Jenna Brown:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://hopebotanicals.com in May 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various animal and human products, all of which your firm promotes as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/hopebotanicalsllc and www.instagram.com/hope botanicals; these websites direct consumers to your website https://hopebotanicals.com to purchase your products.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your products “CBD Horse Pellets” (also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD Pellets for Horses or Livestock”), “Peppermint Flavor Horse Formula,” “Happy Horse Bites,” “CBD Liniment Gel,” “Natural Flavor Pet Formula” (also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD for Pets in Natural Flavor”), and “Beef Flavored Soft Chews,” which you promote as products containing CBD for use in animals, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
In addition, your CBD products for human use (hereinafter collectively referred to as “your CBD-containing products for humans”), include all varieties of “Broad Spectrum Tincture” (also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD”), “Super Full Spectrum Tincture” (also referred to as “Super Full Spectrum CBD”), “Phytocannabinoid-Rich Broad Spectrum Hemp Oil Softgels,” (also referred to as “25mg Broad Spectrum CBD Gel Caps”), and “Broad Spectrum Nano CBD Salve” are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined that your Raspberry Gummies 10 mg CBD Isolate Hemp Extract product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because it bears or contains an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your Raspberry Gummies 10 mg CBD Isolate Hemp Extract product into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
The Agency is particularly concerned that you market CBD products for food-producing animals. In addition to raising potential concerns regarding safety for the animals themselves, CBD products for food-producing animals raise concerns regarding the safety of the human food (meat, milk, and eggs) derived from those animals. There is currently a lack of data on the formation of residues in edible products of food-producing animals in association with the consumption of CBD products by those animals and on safe levels of any potential residues for the human consumer. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved CBD products for food-producing animals.
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website, https://hopebotanicals.com, and your social media websites at www.facebook.com/hopebotanicalsllc and www.instagram.com/hope botanicals, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs “CBD Horse Pellets” (also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD Pellets for Horses or Livestock”), “Peppermint Flavor Horse Formula,” “Happy Horse Bites,” “CBD Liniment Gel,” “Natural Flavor Pet Formula,” and “Beef Flavored Soft Chews.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website https://hopebotanicals.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/hopebotanicalsllc and www.instagram.com/hope botanicals, that show the intended use of your products for animals as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:

Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of your products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
On your testimonials webpage https://hopebotanicals.com/category/testimonials/:
• December 13, 2018 testimonial: “(b)(6)relief from Polyneuritis…to have a special horse and then have them diagnosed with a disease such as polyneuritis is devastating. This disease is very similar to multiple sclerosis in people.”o “(b)(6)has been on Hope Botanicals CBD pellets for one month now. He is now down to 1/4 tablet of previcox once a day.

Dobermans are prone to cancer so I’m thrilled to be giving her CBD for the pain and know that it will kill cancer cells also.”
These products are ""new animal drugs"" under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5). The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
To the extent that you market any of your products containing CBD as animal food, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD1.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception2.
There is no animal food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal foods. FDA’s regulations in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 570.30(a)-(c), 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c), describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30). We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal foods are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://hopebotanicals.com indicates that you intend to market several of your CBD-containing products, including “Broad Spectrum Tincture” (all varieties and also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD”), “Super Full Spectrum Tincture” (also referred to as “Super Full Spectrum CBD”), and “Phytocannabinoid-Rich Broad Spectrum Hemp Oil Softgels,” (also referred to as “25mg Broad Spectrum CBD Gel Caps”), for humans3as dietary supplements. However, these products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website that establish the intended use of your CBD-containing products for humans as drugs include, but not limited to, the following:
On your website https://hopebotanicals.com/category/testimonials/ [similar claims are also found on your website at https://hopebotanicals.com/2018/01/my-husband-was-diagnosed-with-multiple-myeloma/]:
• “On July 7, 2017(b)(6)was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells (aka blood cancer). This particular type of cancer affects many things, low blood counts, difficulty fighting infections, bone and calcium issues and kidney problems to name a few . . . He started taking Hope Botanicals CBD gel cap, 25 mg twice daily, mostly to see if it would help with fatigue, mood and sleep. While the CBD definitely helped with these symptoms, most noteworthy, we began to see his creatinine levels drop substantially . . . They started him again on the CBD gel caps, 50mg every three hours and within 7 hours, he was pain free. As of today,(b)(6)is considered in remission, we believe with help of CBD.
We are very happy to hear such an amazing testimony and very thankful that we could help(b)(6)manage his cancer symptoms.”
On your website https://hopebotanicals.com/category/blog-posts/:
• “The Top 8 Uses for CBD Oil”
o In a graphic, you state: “Cancer[-] CBD may help cancer patients to manage their symptoms and minimize the effects of more intrusive treatments” and “ADHD. . . observational studies show it helps reduce the anxiety and hyperactivity associated with ADHD.”o “CancerMy first customer was a man with multiple myeloma blood cancer. He is in remission . . . The side benefit that my customer didn’t know about is that CBD helped his kidney function. When opiates couldn’t control his pain, CBD did.”o “ADHDMany parents of children with ADHD are looking for other options to prescribed medications for their children. There are many forums for parents researching CBD for ADHD and other subtypes. There is limited research on CBD for ADHD, but observational studies show it helps reduce the anxiety and hyperactivity associated with ADHD.”
Your CBD-containing products for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your Raspberry Gummies 10 mg CBD Isolate Hemp Extract product appears to be promoted as a conventional human food. Specifically, this product is displayed with a Nutrition Facts label on your website. However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling your Raspberry Gummies 10 mg CBD Isolate Hemp Extract product is food to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception4.
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 321(s), and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 348. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food.
Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

1CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
2Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(s)(5), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).
3The CBD-containing products for humans that are marketed as dietary supplements include “Broad Spectrum Tincture” (all varieties and also referred to as “Broad Spectrum CBD”), “Super Full Spectrum Tincture” (also referred to as “Super Full Spectrum CBD”), and “Phytocannabinoid-Rich Broad Spectrum Hemp Oil Softgels,” (also referred to as “25mg Broad Spectrum CBD Gel Caps”).
4Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

RE: 623508
Dear Casey Bales and Brian Frye:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://kahmcbd.com/ in May 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, many of which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/KahmCBD, https://www.instagram.com/kahmcbd/, and https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6RFlgxSlR1TScnz_ig1oUQ; these social media websites direct consumers to your website https://kahmcbd.com/ to purchase your products.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your products “CBD Hemp Pellets” and “K9 Soft Chews,” which you promote as products containing CBD for use in animals, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
In addition, your CBD products for human use, “Kahm EQUIPASS RELIEF GEL,” “Kahm CBD MUSCLE FREEZE ROLL ON,” “Kahm BODY CREAM,” “Kahm CBD BROAD SPECTRUM HEMP EXTRACT” (all varieties), and “Kahm CBD NANO CBD SALVE” (hereinafter “Kahm CBD products for humans”), as well as your “Tanka 30 day CBD Band,” “Tanka T-FLEX Band” and “Tanka Collagen Band,” with respect to their ingredients intended for delivery through the skin (hereinafter “Tanka products for humans”), are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined that your CBD Gummies products in Blue Raspberry and Raspberry flavors are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It is a prohibited act to introduce your CBD Gummies products in Blue Raspberry and Raspberry flavors into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
The Agency is particularly concerned that you market CBD products for food-producing animals. Specifically, your “CBD Hemp Pellets” products bear labels that state, “FOR EQUINE & LIVESTOCK” and display an image of a horse and a cow. In addition to raising potential concerns regarding safety for the animals themselves, CBD products for food-producing animals raise concerns regarding the safety of the human food (meat, milk, and eggs) derived from those animals. There is currently a lack of data on the formation of residues in edible products of food-producing animals in association with the consumption of CBD products by those animals and on safe levels of any potential residues for the human consumer. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved CBD products for food-producing animals.
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website and your social media websites, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs “CBD Hemp Pellets” and “K9 Soft Chews.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website and your social media websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
On your webpage titled “How Kahm CBD can help my horse perform its best” at https://kahmcbd.com/learn/:• “*Stress – …In short, when a horse is stressed or anxious several of those CB1 receptors become out of balance. Supplementing your horse with either a daily CBD pellet for horses, or a CBD oil (also known as tincture), will allow those receptors that are out of balance to reestablish balance and help support calming in that horse. Using CBD to reduce stress in horses has proven successful time and time again.”• “*Inflammation – It doesn’t take a scientist to figure out that more wear and tear on a performance horse’s body means more chronic inflammation. Giving our daily CBD pellets for horses twice a day, allows for a constant level of CBD to remain at a therapeutic level. What this means is, if your horse is experiencing muscle soreness, or ECS receptors that are out of balance in the organs, muscles, and connective tissue causing inflammation, CBD will work constantly to find balance in those receptors and reduce the inflammation associated with everyday activity.”
On your Facebook social media page at https://www.facebook.com/KahmCBD, for “Broad-Spectrum Hemp Pellets”:
• January 10, 2020 posting with pictures of your “CBD Hemp Pellets” product, which includes images of a horse and a cow on the label, and the statement “FOR USE IN HORSES AND LARGE ANIMALS”:o “PROVIDES SUPPORT TO HELP: MANAGE NORMAL STRESS PROMOTE A CALMING EFFECT MAINTAIN A HEALTHY GUT MAINTAIN A NORMAL AND BALANCED BEHAVIOR MAINTAIN HEALTHY JOINTS MAINTAIN A NORMAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE”
On your YouTube social media website at https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6RFlgxSlR1TScnz_ig1oUQ:
• In a Product Display training video dated December 7, 2020 at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BwdqTedTa0, during the discussion of your “CBD Hemp Pellets” (from the 4:52 to 4:55 mark) the presenter states: “It’s also amazing for the anti-inflammatory effects that CBD has.”
On your product webpage for “K9 Soft Chews” (in the picture of the back of the product label):
• “Our canine soft chews are formulated using CBD isolate, passion flower, valerian root, and ginger root to provide relief and support for anxiety, stress, pain, and digestive issues.”These products are ""new animal drugs"" under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, orsuggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5). The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
To the extent that you market any of your products containing CBD as animal food, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.1
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.2
There is no animal food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal foods. FDA’s regulations in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 570.30(a)-(c), 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c), describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30). We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal foods are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://kahmcbd.com/ indicates that you intend to market your Kahm CBD BROAD SPECTRUM HEMP EXTRACT products (all varieties) as dietary supplements.3However, these products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
In addition, although your website shows Supplement Facts panels for the “Tanka T-FLEX Band” and “Tanka Collagen Band,” your products’ labeling states that the products are intended to be worn on the wrist. For example, your website describes how the “patented macromolecular technology works through direct contact with the skin to provide timed controlled-release of up to 30 days.” The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i), 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i), as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your “Tanka T-FLEX Band” and “Tanka Collagen Band” products are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Tanka T-FLEX Band” and “Tanka Collagen Band” products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and your social media websites that provide evidence of the intended uses of your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your Instagram social media website at https://www.instagram.com/kahmcbd/ from posts on July 24, 2018:
• “An article published in the February 2013 issue of The British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology states, ‘CBD. . . inhibits cancer cell migration, adhesion, and invasion.’”
• “A 2016 research study published in the scientific journal Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation concluded, ‘CBD was shown to lower the incidence of diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.’”
On your website https://kahmcbd.com/:
• From your ""Blog"" webpage posting titled ""8 Benefits of CBD Oil"":o ""You've asked . . . about the benefits of CBD oil . . . What can you use it for? Here's a list . . . Reduce dependencies . . . management of pain . . . depression or anxiety . . . you can rely on it for these ailments and avoid any addictive tendencies.""
• From your “Kahm EQUIPASS RELIEF GEL” product webpage:o “Equipass pain relief gel provides soothing relief from discomfort associated with . . . competition, sore muscles, wounds, and minor injuries. This product can be used with and without bandages or magnetic therapy and will not burn or blister. . . . Our all-natural topical relief gel is formulated high-quality herbs, colloidal silver, and Water-Soluble CBD. Making our relief gel extremely effective and safe for both human and animal use.”• From your “Kahm CBD MUSCLE FREEZE ROLL ON” product webpage:o “Our CBD muscle freeze gel with full-spectrum CBD is a great product to use topically on all of your muscle aches and pains. It goes to work fast using medicinal ingredients as well as our Nano CBD.”
• From your “Tanka T-FLEX Band” product webpage:o “Effective for: Arthritis and Reumatoid [sic] arthritis pain relief Joints inflamation [sic] Muscle Soreness Antidioxidant [sic] Improves skin elasticity Minimize wrinkling”
• From your “Tanka Collagen Band” product webpage:o “Effective for: Muscle Mass Arthritis Skin Elasticity”
Based on the above labeling claims, your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are drugs. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here,4new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your Kahm CBD products for humans or Tanka products for humans. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for their intended use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (see 21 CFR 201.5).
Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A), can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Based on claims in their labeling, including website labeling, the aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners, such as cancer, diabetes, depression, and anxiety and arthritis. Therefore, these products are considered prescription drugs and adequate directions for their use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes.
Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products. Consequently, your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
Further, even if your products were marketed only for nonprescription indications, these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section,5and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. In addition, your “Kahm EQUIPASS RELIEF GEL” product would also be misbranded under section 502 of the FD&C Act because it is labeled to contain colloidal silver. Under a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330, as published in the Federal Register on August 17, 1999 (64 FR 44653, 44658, establishing 21 CFR 310.548), the Agency determined that no over-the-counter drugs containing colloidal silver are GRASE under section 201(p)(1) of the FD&C Act and that all such products are deemed to be new drugs and require an approved new drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act to be lawfully marketed. The Agency further determined that in the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the FD&C Act.
The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
CBD-containing Drugs
Even if your Kahm CBD products for humans and Tanka 30 day CBD Band products were considered nonprescription drugs, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks.6Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).7
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your CBD Gummies products in Blue Raspberry and Raspberry flavors appear to be promoted as conventional human foods. For example, the Blue Raspberry product is displayed with a Nutrition Facts label on your website. However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue. According to your product labeling your CBD Gummies products in Blue Raspberry and Raspberry flavors are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.8
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

1CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
2Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(s)(5), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).
3The CBD-containing products for humans that are marketed as dietary supplements include “Broad Spectrum Hemp Extract” (also referred to as “CBD Tincture (Oil)” in various flavors and sizes and Broad Spectrum Hemp Extract soft gels (also referred to as “CBD Soft Gels”).
4For example, under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on claims made in their labeling, including website labeling, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications. Further, even if certain of your products, such as your Kahm CBD products for humans or your Tanka T-FLEX and Collagen Band products, were marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application, notably because CBD, glucosamine, and collagen peptides (respectively)—considered active ingredients under 21 C.F.R. 201.66(b)(2) due to their prominent featuring on the product labeling—were not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or tentative final monograph issued under 21 CFR part 330, for purposes of section 505G(a) of the FD&C Act, nor was marketing of these products permitted by an administrative order under section 505G(b) of the FD&C Act.
5See footnote 4, supra.
6For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. See https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf.
721 CFR 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered."" A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product. Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. As noted, CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.
8Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

RE: 623510
Dear Joy Neely:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address  www.freestateoils.com in May 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you promote as products containing cannabidiol  (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/freestateoils, www.instagram.com/freestateoils,  and twitter.com/freestateoils;  these websites  direct consumers to your website www.freestateoils.com to purchase your products. In addition, FDA has observed that your website offers CBD-containing products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish  that your products “Whisper’s Soothing Grains CBD for Farm Animals,” “Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats” (including “Pack of 6 Chews” and “Jar of 45 Treats”), “Snoop’s Drops CBD Tincture for Dogs (300mg & 1000mg),” and “Eli’s Drops CBD Tincture for Cats,” which you promote as products containing CBD for use in animals, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated  under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
In addition, the claims on your website and social media websites establish that your CBD-containing products for humans2are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans are misbranded  drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined that your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored) and “CBD Gum Drops” are adulterated  under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i),  because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. It also is a prohibited  act to introduce your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored) and “CBD Gum Drops” into interstate  commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory  disease  caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory  syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus  Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued  a declaration  of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.3In addition,  on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential  declaration  of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.4Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization  by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose,  or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized  products for the mitigation,  prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate  commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations  through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including- cannabidiol-cbd.
The Agency is particularly  concerned that you market one of your CBD products for food-producing animals. For example, your “Whisper’s  Soothing Grains CBD for Farm Animals” is marketed for “horses, swine, poultry and other farm animals and pets.” In addition to raising potential concerns regarding safety for the animals themselves, CBD products for food-producing animals raise concerns regarding  the safety of the human food (meat, milk, and eggs) derived from those animals. There is currently a lack of data on the formation of residues  in edible products of food-producing animals in association with the consumption of CBD products by those animals and on safe levels of any potential residues  for the human consumer. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved CBD products for food-producing animals.
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website www.freestateoils.com, and your social media websites at www.facebook.com/freestateoils, www.instagram.com/freestateoils, and twitter.com/freestateoils, FDA determined that your firm is marketing CBD-containing products that are unapproved new animal drugs: “Whisper’s  Soothing Grains CBD for Farm Animals,” “Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats,” “Snoop’s Drops CBD Tincture for Dogs,” and “Eli’s Drops CBD Tincture for Cats.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended  for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease  in animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.freestateoils.com that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
•    Whisper’s Soothing Grains CBD for Farm Animals
o “Formulated by a veterinarian, Whisper’s  Soothing  Grains CBD Pellets for Farm Animals are for horses,  swine, poultry and other farm animals and pets. … especially  formulated to help animals with pain, inflammation, stress, anxiety…”o “… formulated to help farm animals with stress,  anxiety, pain, inflammation, injuries…”
•    Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats
o “… great for nervous dogs, dogs with pain issues and much more.”o “… especially  formulated to help canines with pain, inflammation, stress, anxiety…”o “… formulated to help canines with stress, anxiety, pain, inflammation, injuries…”
•    Snoop’s Drops CBD Tincture for Dogs
o “… specially  formulated to help your pup with pain, inflammation, stress, anxiety…”o “… specially  formulated to help your dog or cat with stress,  anxiety [sic] pain, inflammation…”
•    Eli’s Drops CBD Tincture for Cats
o “… specially  formulated to help your kitty with pain, inflammation, stress, anxiety…”
Additional  claims observed on your website www.freestateoils.com  that establish  the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
On your webpage titled “About CBD” at https://www.freestateoils.com//about-cbd- cannabidiol:
•    “CBD is a potent pain reliever. CBD reduces inflammation. This is important because inflammation is at the root of so many diseases.  CBD is very effective at stopping  epileptic seizures…”•    “CBD IS PURPORTED TO HELP:…Anxiety…Arthritis…Cancer...Epilepsy…Chronic  Pain…Neurodegenerative Diseases…Seizures…Stress…”
On your webpage titled “CBD Dosages  for Animals” at https://www.freestateoils.com/animal-dosages:
•    “Anti -ANXIETY || Anti - INFLAMMATORY || Anti - ARTHRITIC || Relieves PAIN || Anti - SEIZURE || Alleviates  MANY SYMPTOMS OF CANCER”•    ""CBD can be used in an especially  effective and non-toxic way to ease various medical problems in your pets and farm animals.”
Additional  claims observed on your social media sites www.facebook.com/freestateoils, www.instagram.com/freestateoils, and twitter.com/freestateoils  include, but are not limited to, the following:
•    On an August 29, 2020 post on your Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with a graphic that includes a photograph of your Snoop’s  Drops states, “BENEFITS OF HEMP OIL FOR DOGS” and includes,  “Relieves Inflammation,” “Reduces Anxiety & Stress,” and “Reduces Muscle Spasms.”•    On a May 12, 2019 post on Instagram  states, “What can #CBD do for #animals and our #furbabies ~ #anxiety #inflammation #arthritis #pain #seizures  #cancer #cbdoil #health #dogs #cats #horses #cows #freestateoils  ->> freestateoils.com/hemp-cbdpellets-for-farm-animals.”  The post includes a graphic with photographs  of several farm animals and pets, and includes statements such as, “Anti-ANXIETY || Anti - INFLAMMATORY || Anti - ARTHRITIC ||
Relieves PAIN || Anti - SEIZURE || Alleviates  MANY SYMPTOMS OF CANCER” as well as “Helps lower blood sugar levels.”
These products are ""new animal drugs"" under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally  recognized,  among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions  prescribed, recommended, or suggested  in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally  approved new animal drug application,  or index listing  under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated  under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5). The introduction  or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited  under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited  act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction  into interstate  commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial  clinical investigations  have been instituted  and for which the existence of such investigations  has been made public. Based on available  evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.5
According to your product labeling,  your “Whisper’s  Soothing  Grains CBD for Farm Animals” and “Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats” are animal foods to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your product label depicted on your website www.freestateoils.com refers to “Whisper’s  Soothing  Grains CBD for Farm Animals” as “pellets” for horses, swine, poultry, and other farm animals and pets. Additionally,  your product labeldepicted on your website www.freestateoils.com refers to “Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats” as “soft treats just for dogs,” which are “beef flavored and easy to digest.” Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless  the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.6
Food additives  require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no animal food additive regulation that authorizes  the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection  Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal foods. FDA’s regulations  in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility  for classification of an animal food ingredient  as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis  for general recognition  of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available  literature, the data and information necessary  to support the safe use of CBD in animal foods are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including,  but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient  in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated  within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “Whisper’s Soothing Grains CBD for Farm Animals” and “Snoop’s Chews CBD Dog Treats” are adulterated  within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated  animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited  under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at www.freestateoils.com  indicates  that you intend to market some of your CBD-containing products for humans as dietary supplements, including your “Allay CBD Soft Gels,” “Zing CBD Soft Gels,” “Fusion  Water-Soluble  CBD Liquid,” “Water-Soluble  CBD Powder,” and “Fusion Water-Soluble  CBD Vials.” We also note that you may intend to promote your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and  unflavored) as dietary supplements.  Specifically, there is Supplement Facts information on the web pages for all of the products listed above, including  your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored). Your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement  under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement  definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient  in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations  has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.7There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of anyevidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.8
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis,  cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

Your CBD-containing products for humans are not generally  recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable  here, new drugs may not be legally  introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate  commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications  in effect for any of your CBD- containing  products for humans.
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate  directions for use” means directions  under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes  for which it is intended.  (See 21 CFR 201.5). Your CBD-containing products for humans are offered for conditions  that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals  who are not medical practitioners.  Therefore, adequate  directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended  purposes.  Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA- approved labeling are exempt from the requirements  that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson.
However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions  for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited  act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
As discussed  above, although you may intend to market some of your products for human use as dietary  supplements, the products do not meet the definition of dietary supplements under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act. According to your product labeling, your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored) and “CBD Gum Drops” are foods to which CBD has been added. We also note that you may intend to promote your “Fusion Water-Soluble  CBD Liquid,” “Water-Soluble  CBD Powder,” and “Fusion Water-Soluble CBD Vials” as conventional food products. Specifically, you suggest  that consumers  add your “Fusion Water-Soluble  CBD Liquid,” “Water-Soluble  CBD Powder,” and “Fusion Water-Soluble  CBD Vials” to conventional foods such as pudding, cottage cheese, and soup.
In regard to your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored) and “CBD Gum Drops,” and, to the extent you intend to promote your “Fusion Water-Soluble  CBD Liquid,” “Water-Soluble  CBD Powder,” and “Fusion  Water-Soluble  CBD Vials” as conventional food products, you should be aware that it is a prohibited  act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction  into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations  have been instituted  and for which the existence of such investigations  has been made public. FDA has concluded that the prohibition  in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial  clinical investigations  involving the drug had been instituted.  However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that  this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question  its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits  the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended  use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless  the substance is generally recognized  as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.9
Food additives  require premarket approval based on data demonstrating  safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)), and causes the food to be adulterated  under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations  in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification  of a food ingredient  as GRAS. The use of a food substance  may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition  of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions  and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious  concerns about potential  harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published  scientific literature,  identified potential  for liver injury from CBD and potentially  harmful interactions  with certain drugs. In addition,  studies  in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone  levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient  in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing.CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing  an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated  within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “CBD Honey Straws” (flavored and unflavored) and “CBD Gum Drops” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction  of an adulterated  food into interstate  commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

5CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
6Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5)), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512  because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.
7See Footnote 5 above.
8We also note that the labeling for your “Unified Mind CBD E-Liquid” is a “Vape Refill.” The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act as a product  that is “intended for ingestion.” Because vaping is intended to enter the body directly through inhalation, this product is not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Unified Mind CBD E-Liquid”  product does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act for this additional reason.
9Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw  agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior  to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in  or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

WARNING LETTER
April 21, 2022
Ref: CMS # 624606
Dear Mr. Aguayo,
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1610 W. Polo Rd, Grand Prairie, TX from November 4, 2021, through December 7, 2021. Based on the inspectional findings we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. FDA acknowledges the receipt of your e-mail correspondence dated December 30, 2021, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, your finished product specifications for(b)(4)and(b)(4)fail to include established specifications for purity, strength, and composition for the dietary supplement products. When establishing such specifications, a list of tests or references to analytical procedures and appropriate acceptance criteria that are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described should be included.
We acknowledge your response, received December 30, 2021, which acknowledged that specific elements needed to be updated and asserted that “[b]y March 31, 2022, MCACO will update and complete component specifications.” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide updated finished product specifications for review. Additionally, Appendix 2, which you appear to suggest included a copy of revised specifications, was not included in your response.
2. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). Specifically, you have not established ingredient specifications to ensure the purity, strength, and composition of your(b)(4)(120 Capsules, Batch:(b)(4), manufactured on(b)(4)) and(b)(4)(60 capsules, Batch:(b)(4), manufactured on(b)(4)). When establishing such specifications, a list of tests, or references to analytical procedures and appropriate acceptance criteria that are numerical limits, ranges, or other criteria for the tests described should be included.
We acknowledge your response received December 30, 2021, which states, “MCACO initiated an initial review of specifications of components. . .. By March 31, 2022, MCACO will complete the update of component specifications. By April 30, 2022, MCACO will ensure that all involved personnel are trained and updated on the new specification requirements for purchasing, receiving, and testing of components.” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide updated component specifications for our review.
3. You failed to qualify a supplier of a component by establishing the reliability of the supplier's certificate of analysis through confirmation of the results of their tests or examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2)(ii)(A). Specifically, you received from your suppliers Turmeric Root Powder (Supplier Lot:(b)(4)) and Milk Thistle Seed Extract (Supplier Lot:(b)(4)) for use in your(b)(4), and Amla Powder (Supplier Lot:(b)(4)) and Beet Root Powder (Supplier Lot:(b)(4)) for use in your(b)(4), and relied on their Certificate of Analysis (COA) for microbiological testing and heavy metals without first establishing the reliability of the supplier's certificate of analysis through confirmation of the results of their tests or examinations. Additionally, you have never conducted heavy metal and microbiological tests to confirm results provided by the supplier’s COA.
We acknowledge your response received on December 30, 2021, which states that you reviewed your procedure for Supplier Partnership Program(b)(4)and that you will update specific elements to document and establish the reliability of suppliers by March 31, 2022. You stated that by(b)(4), MCACO will set up a random testing method for verification of supplier components, which could be internal or external compared to the reported certificate of analysis of each supplier. You also stated that by(b)(4), MCACO will have completed all reliability of suppliers through additional testing as necessary to confirm and verify the results of supplier certificates. Your response also provided a document titled, “Supplier Partnership Program” as Appendix 2, Attachment 2. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide documentation to support that you have qualified the results of your supplier’s certificate of analysis for you to be able to rely on their microbial and heavy metal results.
4. You failed to verify that the laboratory examination and testing methodologies are appropriate for their intended use, as required by 21 CFR 111.320(a). Specifically, your(b)(4)dietary supplement contains(b)(4), and(b)(4). You conduct infrared testing (IR) on the finished product, purportedly to confirm the identity and composition of the contents; however, the results of your IR tests do not identify the identity and composition of the contents encapsulated as the finished dietary supplement.
We acknowledge your response received December 30, 2021, which acknowledges that you do not have documentation of the testing methods used in certain documents, specifically for microbial testing and heavy metal testing. Your response states the tests performed were not documented on the specification’s sheets for components or finished product and that there was no documentation for the reasoning of using IR testing for identification of final product. You state that, on December 23, 2021, you reviewed and identified the policies, procedures and forms that were missing the testing method used for results, and that by(b)(4), you plan to have updated all the related documents (e.g., supplier partnership program, specifications of components, specifications of final product, Master Manufacturing Record, Batch production records and final product Certificates of Analysis) and that you will document the reason for using IR testing for identification. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide documentation to verify that the laboratory examination and testing methodologies that you use are appropriate for their intended use.
5. You failed to establish master manufacturing records (MMRs) that include all required components of 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your master manufacturing records for(b)(4)(120 Capsules) and(b)(4)(60 Capsules) failed to include:
The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredient list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)];
A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)]; and
Written instructions, including specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)].
We acknowledge your response, received on December 30, 2021, in which you state you have reviewed a sampling of MMRs and determined that certain elements are missing including verification points. You also state that since production of various products is limited to(b)(4), you will ensure that elements in their MMRs are updated by(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide an updated MMR for review.
6. You failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, including the use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing test and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, your Product Testing and Release Procedure ((b)(4)) states each time a component is analyzed it is added to the IR library as a reference standard. In accordance with your procedure,(b)(4)Batch(b)(4)was added to the IR library as a reference standard; however, your batch analysis does not include data to support that the batch was thoroughly characterized to ensure its identity, purity, quality, and strength. When using in-house or non-compendia reference standards, the batch should be prepared from a representative lot that is thoroughly characterized to be acceptable as a reference standard using appropriate testing methodologies.
7. You failed to ensure that the person who conducts a material review and makes the disposition decision, at the time of performance, documented that material review and disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.113(c). Specifically, on November 4, 2021, your management provided our investigator a copy of the BPR for an unreleased batch of(b)(4)(60 capsules, Batch:(b)(4), manufactured on(b)(4)). On November 17, 2021, your management provided our Investigator a copy of the documentation relating to the same batch, except that the November 17, 2021, version of the BPR provided to our investigator had been completed and approved for release, signed, and dated September 29, 2021 (over a month before an unsigned and undated version of this document was first provided to our investigator). The documentation for this batch demonstrates that the documentation of the material review and disposition decision was not made at the time of performance. Additionally, note that 21 CFR 111.260(m) requires documentation at the time of performance any required material review and disposition decision. The expectation is that you will accurately document the current date at the time of the review and disposition.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to Dana Lewis, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at the following email: dana.lewis@fda.hhs.gov (preferred) or you may mail a hard copy, addressed to Dana Lewis, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration at 1201 Main Street, Suite 7200, Dallas, TX 75202.

RE: 622337
Dear Sir or Madame:
This letter concerns your products Brute BCAA and Predator Pro, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-  act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The labels of your products Brute BCAA and Predator Pro declare 5a-Hydroxy-Laxogenin, an abbreviated name for 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin,1as a dietary ingredient; however, 5-alpha-hydroxy- laxogenin is not a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. 5-alpha- hydroxy-laxogenin does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because it is not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin used in your products, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin is not generally recognized as safe under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Brute BCAA and Predator Pro products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.

RE: 622405
Dear Sir or Madame:
This letter concerns your products Shredded-AF, Charged-AF, Alpha-AF, 3-EPI-Andro, Focused-AF, and Amped-AF, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws- enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The label of your product Shredded-AF declares hordenine HCl as a dietary ingredient. The label of your product Charged-AF declares higenamine HCl as a dietary ingredient. The label of your product Alpha- AF declares 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin as a dietary ingredient and the label of your product 3-EPI-Andro declares 5a-hydroxy laxogenin, a shortened name for 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin,1as a dietary ingredient. However, hordenine HCl, higenamine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not dietary ingredients.
Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Hordenine HCl, higenamine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxy- laxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because they are not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substances for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)].Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the hordenine HCl, higenamine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin used in your products, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
Hordenine HCl, higenamine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not generally recognized as safe under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because hordenine HCl, higenamine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your products Shredded AF, Charged-AF, Alpha-AF, and 3- Epi-Andro are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: New Dietary Ingredient
The label of your Focused-AF product declares higenamine as a dietary ingredient. The label of your product Amped-AF declares hordenine as a dietary ingredient. Higenamine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of aconite, asarum, lotus, and other botanicals. Hordenine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of barley and other botanicals. As explained below, higenamine and hordenine are also “new dietary ingredients” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1.    The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2.    There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that higenamine and hordenine were lawfully marketed as dietary ingredients in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that higenamine and hordenine have been present in the food supply as articles used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. Therefore, higenamine and hordenine are subject to the premarket new dietary ingredient notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. FDA has not received any NDI notifications pertaining to the use of higenamine or hordenine have in dietary supplements. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that higenamine and hordenine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing higenamine or hordenine would still be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that higenamine and hordenine do not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing higenamine or hordenine are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)]. The introduction into interstate commerce of dietary supplements that are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C.§ 331(a) and (v)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters.

If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.

Dear Mr. DiMaggio:
This letter concerns your products CBD Gummies, Ephedra Stack, Lean Fuel V2 and Stimulate, which are labeled as dietary supplements.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements.
Based on our review of your website https://ironmaglabs.com and other relevant evidence, CBD Gummies, Ephedra Stack, Lean Fuel V2, and Stimulate are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(a)]. Furthermore, your CBD-containing product is a misbranded drug under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these unapproved and misbranded drugs for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc-act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.Adulterated Dietary Supplements: New Dietary Ingredients
The label of your Ephedra Stack product declares higenamine as a dietary ingredient. The label of your Stimulate and Lean Fuel V2 products declare hordenine as a dietary ingredient. Higenamine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of aconite, asarum, lotus, and other botanicals. Hordenine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of barley and other botanicals.
As explained below, higenamine and hordenine are also “new dietary ingredients” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that hordenine or higenamine were lawfully marketed as dietary ingredients in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that hordenine or higenamine have been present in the food supply as articles used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. Therefore, hordenine and higenamine are subject to the premarket new dietary ingredient notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. FDA has not received any NDI notifications pertaining to the use of hordenine or higenamine in dietary supplements. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)].

The introduction into interstate commerce of dietary supplements that are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://www.ironmaglabs.com/product/cbd-gummies/ indicates that you intend to market your CBD Gummies product as a dietary supplement. For example, your CBD Gummies product contains a Supplements Facts panel, as well as a statement of identity identifying it as a dietary supplement. However, your CBD Gummies product cannot be a dietary supplement because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii), but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at https://ironmaglabs.com in January 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products CBD Gummies, Ephedra Stack, Lean Fuel V2, and Stimulate. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as a drug include the following:
Ephedra Stack(https://www.ironmaglabs.com/product/ephedra-stack/))• “White Willow Bark is an herbal form of aspirin and is a natural pain reliever.”
Lean Fuel V2(https://www.ironmaglabs.com/product/leanfuel-v2/)• Under the heading The Power Behind LeanFuel V2: “anti-inflammatory compounds”• “D-phenylalanine is also used as a pain reliever…”• “Uva Ursi … possesses an anti-inflammatory properties. The benefits if reducing systemic inflammation are too numerous to mention here, as this process is related to just about every degenerative disease experienced by modern society”• “Uva Ursi helps correct this imbalance by reducing inflammation…”
Stimulate(https://www.ironmaglabs.com/product/stimulate)• “White Willow Bark has the ability to naturally minimize pain and inflammation.”
CBD Gummies(https://www.ironmaglabs.com/product/cbd-gummies/)• “Pain … Relief”• “Decreases Anxiety & Depression”• “Lower blood pressure”• “Lower intestinal inflammation”• “Relieve depression”• “Help with alcohol and nicotine addiction”• “Neurodegenerative diseases”• “Reduce chronic pain”• “Reduce Inflammation”
Your Ephedra Stack, Lean Fuel V2, Stimulate and CBD Gummies products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product CBD Gummies is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, the CBD Gummies fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

Dear Mr. March:
This letter concerns your products New God of Rage, God of War, New God of Fire, Legion: Extreme Fat Burner, Laxovar: Natural Recomposition, and Uprising: Natural Testosterone Support which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-andcosmetic-act-fdc-act, and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements: Unsafe Food Additives
The labels of the following products declare dietary ingredients: New God of Rage declares higenamine HCl & hordenine HCl, God of War declares hordenine HCl, New God of Fire declares hordenine HCl, Legion: Extreme Fat Burner declares higenamine HCl, Laxovar: Natural Recomposition declares 5ahydroxy-laxogenin, an abbreviated name for 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin1, and Uprising: Natural Testosterone Support declares 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin. However, higenamine HCl, hordenine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not dietary ingredients. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. Higenamine HCl, hordenine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because they are not a vitamin, a mineral, an amino acid, an herb or other botanical, a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or a combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the higenamine HCl, hordenine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin used in your products, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
Higenamine HCl, hordenine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not generally recognized as safe under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because higenamine HCl, hordenine HCl, and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your New God of Rage, God of War, New God of Fire, Legion: Extreme Fat Burner, Laxovar: Natural Recomposition, and Uprising: Natural Testosterone Support products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain unsafe food additives.

RE: 622401
Dear Mr. Peterson:
This letter concerns your products Lipo Red and StimoVEX XT, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and- cosmetic-act-fdc-act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The label of your product StimoVEX XT declares hordenine HCl as a dietary ingredient; however, hordenine HCl is not a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. Hordenine HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because it is not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the hordenine HCl used in your product, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
Hordenine HCl is not generally recognized as safe under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement product. Because hordenine HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your StimoVEX XT product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because it contains an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: New Dietary Ingredient
The label of your Lipo Red product declares octopamine as a dietary ingredient. Octopamine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of bitter orange and other botanicals. As explained below, octopamine is also a “new dietary ingredient” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1.    The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2.    There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that octopamine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that octopamine has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. Therefore, octopamine is subject to the premarket new dietary ingredient notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. FDA has not received any NDI notifications pertaining to the use of octopamine in dietary supplements. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. The introduction of such adulterated dietary supplements into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

RE: 622403
Dear Mr. Cohen:
This letter concerns your product Synedrex, which is labeled as a dietary supplement. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) because the product is an adulterated dietary supplement. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdc- act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: New Dietary Ingredients
The label of your Synedrex product declares octopamine, hordenine, and higenamine as dietary ingredients. Octopamine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C.§ 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of bitter orange and other botanicals. Hordenine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of barley and other botanicals. Higenamine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(F)] because it is a constituent of aconite, asarum, lotus, and other botanicals. As explained below, octopamine, hordenine, and higenamine are also “new dietary ingredients” (i.e., dietary ingredients not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1.    The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2.    There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that octopamine, hordenine, or higenamine were lawfully marketed as dietary ingredients in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that octopamine, hordenine, or higenamine have been present in the food supply as articles used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. Therefore, octopamine, hordenine, and higenamine are subject to the premarket new dietary ingredient notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. FDA has not received any NDI notifications pertaining to the use of octopamine, hordenine, or higenamine in dietary supplements. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that hordenine or higenamine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as dietary ingredients. Therefore, even if new dietary ingredient notifications had been submitted for hordenine and higenamine, dietary supplements containing hordenine or higenamine would still be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that hordenine and higenamine do not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing hordenine or higenamine are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)]. The introduction into interstate commerce of dietary supplements that are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].

Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The label of your product “DR1” declares 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin as a dietary ingredient; however, 5- alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin is not a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because it is not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.

Dear Mr. Lovatt:
This letter concerns your products Lean Muscle For Her and Lean Muscle, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-andcosmetic-act-fdc-act and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The labels of your products Lean Muscle for Her and Lean Muscle declare 5a-Hydroxy-Laxogenin, an abbreviated name for 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin,1 as a dietary ingredient; however, 5-alpha-hydroxylaxogenin is not a dietary ingredient. Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories. 5-alphahydroxy-laxogenin does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act because it is not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any dietary ingredient from the preceding categories.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)].

Because 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Lean Muscle For Her and Lean Muscle products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].

Dear Ms. Ward:
This letter concerns your products Thermo Burn and 5-Alpha, which are labeled as dietary supplements. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) because the products are adulterated dietary supplements. You can find the FD&C Act through links on FDA’s website at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/laws-enforced-fda/federal-food-drug-and-cosmetic-act-fdcact and the FDA regulations at https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement: Unsafe Food Additive
The label of your product Thermo Burn declares higenamine HCl as a dietary ingredient and the labeling for your product 5-Alpha declares 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin as a dietary ingredient.1However, hordenine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not dietary ingredients.
Under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)], a dietary ingredient is a vitamin; a mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of the preceding substances. Higenamine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act because they are not a vitamin; a mineral; an amino acid; an herb or other botanical; a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types.
If a substance is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive. Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)]. Adulterated foods cannot be legally imported or marketed in the United States.
Section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(s)] exempts dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements from the food additive definition. However, non-dietary ingredients intended for use in dietary supplements, such as the higenamine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin used in your products, are not exempt from the food additive definition and must meet the same requirements as substances added to conventional foods. In other words, a non-dietary ingredient added to a dietary supplement must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation or be GRAS for its intended use, unless it qualifies for another exception to the food additive definition.
Higenamine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxy-laxogenin are not generally recognized as safe under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because higenamine HCl and 5-alpha-hydroxylaxogenin do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Thermo Burn and 5-Alpha products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

1Although your Supplement Facts label for 5-Alpha lists the ingredient as “Laxogenin,” your product webpage for 5-Alpha at https://www.blackdragon-labs.com/products/5-alpha-anabolic-testosterone-agent/, where the product is available for purchase, lists the product ingredients and states “Laxogenin - short for 5-Alpha-Hydroxy-Laxogenin.”

RE: # 618368

Dear Delta 8 Hemp:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://delta8thc.market/ in April 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human products, which you represent as containing Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).Theclaims on your website establish that your products,some of which are available in multiple varieties, “Delta 8 THC Distillate Oil,"" “Delta 8 THC Vape Cartridge,” “Delta 8 THC Disposable Vape Pen,”  “Delta 8 THC Tincture,” “Delta 8 Infused Gummies,” and “Delta 8 Infused Sour Gummies” (hereinafter referred to as “Delta-8 THC products for humans”), are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).  Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined thatyour “Delta 8 Infused Gummies” and “Delta 8 Infused Sour Gummies” products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act,21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.  You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD-containing products. FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children.  Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products that may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on a review of your websites,your Delta-8 THC products for humansaredrugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your website https://delta8thc.market/ that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your blog post titled, “3 Ways to Boost Your Immune System with Delta-8 THC”:
“Delta-8 THC can be used to suppress the immune response in your body. If a patient is suffering from autoimmune diseases, Delta-8 THC will offer some relief and support. Some of these diseases include lupus, HIV/AIDS, and multiple sclerosis.”
“Delta-8 THC prevents rapid cell growth while promoting cellular death . . . people who have a hyperactive immune system will gain significantly since such properties assist in the healing process.”
“If you have cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and migraines, Delta-8 THC can help alleviate the pain because it has immunosuppressant properties.”
“[R]esearchers have currently noted that Delta-8 THC reduces inflammation, prevents autoimmune diseases, and offers pain relief.”
On your blog post titled, “Does Delta-8 THC help to Reduce Anxiety?”:
“Where there are many benefits of Delta-8 THC, such as ways to boost your immune system with Delta-8 THC, some reason [sic] to try Delta-8 THC are as follows:Substance Abuse Treatment”
Substance Abuse Treatment”
“Yes, Delta-8 THC does help to reduce anxiety.”
On your webpage titled, “What is Delta 8 THC?”:
“In non-medical terms, researchers linked Delta 8-THC to anti-nausea (antiemetic), anti-anxiety (anxiolytic), and pain relief (analgesic) benefits, among other effects . . . It could also protect brain cells thanks to its neuroprotective effects.”
“The most notable benefits linked to Delta 8-THC include:Help with pain and inflammationEliminate nausea in cancer patients”
Help with pain and inflammation
Eliminate nausea in cancer patients”
Posted on this page is your YouTube video titled “What is this Delta 8 Stuff?” which includes the text “Delta-8 is known to be successful in many cancer treatments.”
Your Delta-8 THCproducts for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p).  With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a).  FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your Delta-8 THCproducts for humans are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) Your Delta-8 THC products for humans are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your “Delta 8 Infused Gummies” and “Delta 8 Infused Sour Gummies”products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[1]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety.  Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i).  Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC.  We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181).  Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods.  FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS.  The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958.  Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status.  Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food.  Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act.  Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing.  Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food.  Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act.Therefore, your “Delta 8 Infused Gummies” and “Delta 8 Infused Sour Gummies” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive.  Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

RE: # 618341
Dear Chase Slappey:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet addresswww.atlrx.comin February 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD) or Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).We have also reviewed your social media websites athttps://twitter.com/AtlantaRx,https://www.facebook.com/ATLANTARX,andhttps://www.instagram.com/atlanta.rx/;which direct consumers to your websitewww.atlrx.comtopurchase your products.The claims on your website and social media accounts establish that your products,some of which are available in multiple varieties, “Delta 8 Terpene Gummies,” “Delta 8 Chocolate,” “Delta 8 THC Caramels,” “Delta 8 Gummies,” “Delta 8 THC Soft Gel Capsules,” “CBD Sleep Gummies,” “CBD Gummies,” “CBD Capsules,” “Delta 8 THC Tincture,” “CBD Oil Tincture,” “CBD Salve,” “CBD Topical Full Spectrum Lotion,” and “CBD Lavender Scented Hand Sanitizer” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans”),are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d).  Furthermore, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
In addition, your “CBD Pet Oil Tincture” and “CBD Pet Treats” products, which are available in multiple varieties, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and are adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
FDA has also determined thatcertainfoodproducts that you market are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act,21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce into interstate commerce any food to which CBD has been added (see section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll)).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.

“Delta 8 THC gummies can provide appetite stimulation among many users, making them ideal for treating eating disorders such as anorexia or even for those who just do not get hungry often enough and need an appetite boost.”
Based on the abovelabeling claims, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for human use are drugs.We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products aregenerally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for human use are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here,[1]new drugsmay not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans. There is no basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
YourCBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.)
These products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effectfor your products.[2]The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
CBD-containing Drugs
Even if your“CBD Salve,” “CBD Topical Full Spectrum Lotion,” and “CBD Lavender Scented Hand Sanitizer” were considered nonprescription drugs, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. CBD is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).[3],[4]
301(II) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your “CBD Sleep Gummies” and “CBD Gummies” products appear to be promoted as conventional foods.  Specifically, you promote “CBD Sleep Gummies” as “tast[ing] amazing,” and the product labels for both products refer to their flavor.
However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[5]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food.  Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, there is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods.
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
In addition, according to your product labeling, your “Delta 8 Chocolate” and “Delta 8 THC Caramels” are foods to which Delta 8 THC has been added. Your “Delta 8 Terpene Gummies” and “Delta 8 Gummy” products also appear to be conventional foods to which Delta 8 THC has been added. Specifically, you promote these products with the claims “assorted variety of delicious new flavors!” and “More delicious and new flavors.”
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your“Delta 8 Chocolate” and “Delta 8 THC Caramels” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated foods and other adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your“CBD Pet Oil Tincture” and “CBD Pet Treats” are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your websitehttps://www.atlrx.com/, and your social mediawebsites https://www.facebook.com/ATLANTARX/, https://www.instagram.com/atlanta.rx/, and https://twitter.com/AtlantaRx, that establish the intended use of these productsas drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
From your website https://www.atlrx.com/:
On your product page for “CBD Pet Treats”:
“CBD is . . . easing any anxiety present.”
On your blog post titled “New Pet Treat Formulation”:

Known for helping with joint pain, anxiety, lack of appetite, skin problems and other issues. #cbdforpets”
Your“CBD Pet Oil Tincture” and “CBD Pet Treats” products are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(II) and Adulterated Animal Foods
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[6]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i).  Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal food. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal food are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity.  Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing.  CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “CBD Pet Treats” is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of this adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Additionally, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, your “CBD Pet Treats” is an animal food to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your product page on your website, https://www.atlrx.com/, includes the following description: “The easiest way to integrate CBD into your furry friend's diet! These treats are 100% grain and gluten free. No meat by-products, added salt, corn, soy, or artificial colors and flavors, making them ideal for dogs with restrictive diets . . . Our CBD Pet treats also contain the superfood ingredients blueberry and cranberry, providing them with a daily source of vitamins and antioxidants.” Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.

[1]For example, under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met, including conformity with an applicable OTC monograph. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on your claims regarding these products, including on your website labeling, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications. Further, even if certain of your products, such as your “CBD Lavender Scented Hand Sanitizer,” were marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application. For example, CBD —considered an active ingredient under 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) due to its prominent featuring on your product labeling—is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
[2]Further, even if your products were marketed only for nonprescription indications, these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section (see footnote 1) and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.
[3]21 CFR 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered."" A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.
[4]Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.
[5]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
[6]Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition.  If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER
May 4, 2022
RE: # 618701
Dear Terry Maxwell:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://m6labs.com in February 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD) or Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The claims on your website establish that your products, most of which are available in multiple varieties, “Silver Lake Delta 8 Uncut Glass Dab Syringe,” “Silver Lake CBD MCT Oil Tincture,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Avocado Oil Tincture,” “Chaz Ortiz CBD 500mg Essential Balm,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD 500mg Balm Stick,” “Silver Lake CBD Vegan Chew,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Nobel Hemp Delta 8 Vegan Gummy,” “Silver Lake Delta 8 Atomic Crystals,” “Silver Lake Delta 8 Tincture,” “Silver Lake Delta 8 Infused Sugar,” “Silver Lake Vegan Chews Delta 8,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews,” and “Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans”) are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). In addition, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
In addition, your products, which are available in multiple varieties, “Magnolia Botanicals MB Pets Hemp Oil,” “Nobel Hemp Pet Comfort Tincture,” and “Silver Lake Pet Comfort Tincture” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD-containing products for animals”) are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and are adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
FDA has also determined thatyour “Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Silver Lake Delta-8 Atomic Crystals,” “Silver Lake Delta 8 Infused Sugar,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” “Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar,” and “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews” food products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act,21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your“Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” “Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar,” and “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews”products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD-containing products. FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc.  This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products, and Delta-8 THC may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://m6labs.com indicates that you intend to market your CBD products “Silver Lake CBD MCT Oil Tincture” and “Silver Lake CBD Vegan Chew” as dietary supplements. The product webpages display an image appearing to be a supplement facts panel. However, your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.[1]There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on a review of your website,your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humansaredrugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your website https://m6labs.com that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your blog post titled, “What is Hemp Derived Delta 8 THC?”
“Fighting Cancer . . . Δ8 may also have cancer-fighting properties . . . [t]he researchers treated mice with cancer for 20 consecutive days with a combination of the isomer and cannabinol. The result? Tumors reduced in size.”
“Reducing Anxiety . . . Δ8 also has anxiolytic properties . . ..”
“Potential Treatment for Weight Disorders”
“Δ8 isomer . . . raised levels of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, in certain areas of mice brains . . . The relevance of these findings to future dementia research is easy to apprehend when you consider that Alzheimer’s disease is characterized by declining levels of acetylcholine in the human brain.”
“Δ8 improves cognitive function. In the course of the study, they gave oral doses of the isomer to rats with encephalomyelitis, a damaging inflammation of the brain and the spinal cord, and noticed that the neurological function improved.”
“[T]opical Δ8 isomer applications lowered corneal pain and inflammation in rats.”
“The isomer offers many benefits . . . include improved appetite, anxiety reduction, pain relief and improved cognitive function. In addition, the isomer has antiemetic and cancer-fighting properties.”
On your blog post titled, “How Does CBD Make You Feel?”
“CBD helps relieve pain, inflammation, nausea, and seizures in many cases.”
“CBD is believed to be helpful in the treatment of insomnia and anxiety.”
“People who undergo chemotherapy for cancer often suffer from terrible nausea. In some cases, CBD products may help suppress such nausea.”
On your blog post titled, “What is CBD and What Does CBD Stand For?”
“From pain to inflammation, depression, and insomnia, cannabidiol has been tried on people to treat a wide variety of health issues. The strongest scientific evidence of its medical effects, however, lies in its ability to treat serious childhood epilepsy in conditions such as the Dravet syndrome.”
“[C]annabidiol is of some use in the treatment of some cancers.”
“CBD is not a cure-all, but there is anecdotal evidence to show that it can be safe and effective for a variety of health conditions, including autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, digestive disorders, cardiovascular dysfunction, chronic pain, and skin conditions.”
On your Magnolia Botanicals CBD Avocado Oil Tinctures product webpage
“Avocado oil is rich in antioxidants such as lutein which may help decrease inflammation and blood pressure levels.”
Your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for human use are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these productsare “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.)Your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for these products.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your “Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar,” and “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews” products are foods to which CBD has been added. We note that these products are marketed as containing varying quantities of CBD.
However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your “Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar,” and “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews” products are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[2]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181).  Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act.Therefore, your “Nobel Hemp CBD Snapping Rocks,” “Nobel Hemp CBD Chews,” “Magnolia Botanicals CBD Canna Rocks Popping Candy,” “Silver Lake CBD Infused Sugar,” and “Magnolia Botanicals Vegan Hemp Chews” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, according to your product labeling, your “Silver Lake Delta 8 Atomic Crystals” and “Silver Lake Delta 8 Infused Sugar” products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods.
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Silver Lake Delta 8 Atomic Crystals” and “Silver Lake Delta 8 Infused Sugar” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website, https://m6labs.com, FDA determined that your firm is marketing CBD-containing products for animals that are unapproved new animal drugs. Based on our review of your website, your CBD-containing products for animals are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website https://m6labs.com that show the intended use of your products for animals as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your product page for “Magnolia Botanicals MB Pets Hemp Oil”:
“[S]upport the reduction of symptoms associated with seizure disorders, ease inflammation and pain . . . and reduce anxiety and nervousness.”
On your product page for “Nobel Hemp Pet Comfort Tincture”:
“[S]upport the reduction of symptoms associated with seizure disorders, ease inflammation and pain . . . and reduce anxiety and nervousness.”
On your product pages for “Silver Lake Pet Comfort Tincture”:
“[S]upport the reduction of symptoms associated with seizure disorders, may help ease inflammation and pain . . . and could reduce anxiety and nervousness.”
YourCBD-containing products for animals are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

[1]CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
[2]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

WARNING LETTER
May 4, 2022
RE: #618460
Dear Jonathan Levitt:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.biomdplus.com in February 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD) or Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC).We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://twitter.com/bioMDplus, https://www.facebook.com/bioMDplus/ andhttps://www.instagram.com/biomdplus/, whichdirect consumers to your websitewww.biomdplus.com topurchase your products.The claims on your website and social media accounts establish that your products,some of which are available in multiple varieties, “CBD Oil,” “CBD Capsules,” “Vegan CBD Gummies,” “CBD Pain Relief Cream,” “Delta 8 THC Gummies,” and “Delta 8 THC Vape Cartridge” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans”) are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
In addition, your “Natural Pet CBD Oil” is an unapproved new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and is adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
FDA has also determined that certain food products that you market are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD-containing products. FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products, and Delta-8 THC may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at www.biomdplus.comindicates that you appear to market your CBD-containing “CBD Capsules” and “Vegan CBD Gummies” as dietary supplements. For example, the product webpages display a product label image with “hemp supplement” on them. However, your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.[1]There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on a review of your website and social media accounts,your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humansaredrugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims from your website www.biomdplus.com and social media accounts,https://twitter.com/bioMDplus, https://www.facebook.com/bioMDplus/ and https://www.instagram.com/biomdplus/, that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

“Begin by rubbing small amounts of CBD cream to the affected area and wait for about an hour. You can increase the quantity depending on how fast it works. If the effects of the cream are slow to kick in, then its [sic] recommended to re-apply CBD cream after every 3-4 hours. . . . Using CBD cream is like using a moisturizing lotion, but making sure to apply the optimal dosage of CBD cream isn’t easy. Users have to determine the milligrams of CBD in the cream and decide whether it’s good enough for pain relief. CBD creams with low amounts of CBD will probably be less useful than those with higher concentrations. Begin by using small amounts of CBD cream before slowly increasing it until you find relief. Moreover, applying CBD cream on the body isn’t known to produce any significant side effects.”
“CBD creams work when directly applied to the skin, which makes them an excellent alternative to traditional creams when it comes to pain relief. . . . For the most part, the effects of CBD cream can be felt 15-20 minutes and can keep working for as long as 6 hours or more.”
“Applying CBD-infused creams is generally a straightforward process. Look for the areas of your body most affected by pain and discomfort, and apply small amounts of CBD cream around those areas for local treatment. . . . Elbows, knees, and joint . . . Bottoms of the feet and impact points . . . Face, particularly around the temples and the nose . . . Neck and shoulders”

Based on the above labeling claims, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for human use are drugs. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for human use are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p).With certain exceptions not applicable here,[2]new drugsmay not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans. There is no basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
YourCBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) These products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effectyour products.[3]
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
CBD-containing Drugs
Even if your “CBD Pain Relief Cream” was considered a nonprescription drug, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. CBD is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).[4],[5]
Adulterated Human Foods
According to your product labeling, your “Delta 8 THC Gummies” product is a food to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
You should be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in it becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[6]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act.Therefore, your “Delta 8 THC Gummies” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Introduction of these adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

Your“Natural Pet CBD Oil” product is a “new animal drug” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. This product is not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of this adulterated drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

[1]CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect.  Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
[2]For example, under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met, including conformity with an applicable OTC monograph. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on your claims regarding these products, including on your website labeling, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications.  Further, even if certain of your products, such as your “CBD Pain Relief Cream” were marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application. For example, CBD — considered an active ingredient under 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) due to its prominent featuring on your product labeling — is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
[3]Further, even if your products were marketed only for nonprescription indications,these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section (see footnote 1) and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.
[4]21 CFR 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered."" A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.
[5]Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.
[6]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

WARNING LETTER
May 4, 2022
RE: # 625058
Dear Ms. Rogers:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.kingdomharvest.com from October 2021 through April 2022 andhas determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you represent as containing cannabidiol (CBD) or Delta-8 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We have also reviewed your social media websites athttps://www.facebook.com/originalkingdomharvest/ andhttps://www.instagram.com/kingdomharvest/?hl=en;which direct consumers to your websitewww.kingdomharvest.comto purchase your products.The claims on your website and social media accounts establish that your products, some of which are available in multiple varieties, “D8 sublingual oil,” “Delta 8 Disposable Vape Cartridge,” “Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “CBD Vape,” “Blood Sugar Support,”“CBD Gummies,” “Stella’s Baby Care Diaper Cream,” “Pain Relieving CBD Cream,” “Pain Relieving Cream,” “CBD & Menthol Pain Freeze Roll-On,”“Immune Boost Water Soluble Mix,” “Broad-Spectrum THC Free Organic Honey,” “CBD Fair-Trade Coffee,” “CBD Infused Organic Tea,” “Delta 8 Chewing Gum,” “Delta 8 Gummies,” “Delta 8 Peanut Brittle,” and “Delta 8 Syrup,” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans”), are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
FDA has also determined that your “Broad-Spectrum THC Free Organic Honey,” “CBD Fair-Trade Coffee,” “CBD Infused Organic Tea,” “Delta 8 Chewing Gum,” “Delta 8 Gummies” (all varieties), “Delta 8 Peanut Brittle,” “Delta 8 Syrup,” “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract,” and “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets” products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Broad-Spectrum THC Free Organic Honey,” “CBD Fair-Trade Coffee,” “CBD Infused Organic Tea,” “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract,” and “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
In addition, the claims on your website and social media websites establish thatyour products, “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract,” “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets,” “CBD Infused Pet Shampoo,” and “CBD Infused Pet Paw Balm,” which you promote as products containing CBD for use in animals, are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and are adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates cannabis-derived products athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
The Agency is particularly concerned that you market CBD products for food-producing animals. Specifically, your website promotes your “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract” product for use in cows and other large variety ranch and livestock animals. In addition to raising potential concerns regarding safety for the animals themselves, CBD products for food-producing animals raise concerns regarding the safety of the human food (meat, milk, and eggs) derived from those animals. There is currently a lack of data on the formation of residues in edible products of food-producing animals in association with the consumption of CBD products by those animals and on safe levels of any potential residues for the human consumer. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved CBD products for food-producing animals.
Over the past several years, FDA has warned the public on various illegally marketed CBD containing products, including those marketed for infants, such as your “Stella’s Baby Care Diaper Cream.”[1]FDA has also observed a proliferation of products containing another cannabinoid, Delta-8 THC, and has recently expressed serious concerns about products containing Delta-8 THC that include: 1) Delta-8 THC products have not been evaluated or approved by FDA for safe use and may be marketed in ways that put the public health at risk; 2) FDA has received adverse event reports involving Delta-8 THC containing products; 3) Delta-8 THC has psychoactive and intoxicating effects; 4) FDA is concerned about the processes used to create the concentrations of Delta-8 THC claimed in the marketplace; and 5) FDA is concerned about Delta-8 THC products that may be consumed by children, as some packaging and labeling may appeal to children. Seehttps://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/5-things-know-about-delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol-delta-8-thc. This letter is to inform you that your firm markets Delta-8 THC-containing products, and Delta-8 THC may pose a serious health risk to consumers.
We also observed that your website makes claims that your products may be intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.[2]
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at www.kingdomharvest.com indicates that you intend to market some of your CBD products, including, but not limited to, “Immune Boost Water Soluble Mix,” and all varieties of “Blood Sugar Support” and “CBD Gummies” as dietary supplements. For example, the product website describes “Immune Boost Water Soluble Mix” with reference to the goal of creating a “high-quality supplement” and the product websites expressly describe each “Blood Sugar Support” and “CBD Gummies” product as a “dietary supplement.” Your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.[3]There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional human food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on a review of your websites, yourCBD and Delta-8 THC products for humansaredrugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your product labeling, including your website and social media websites, that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

Based on the above labeling claims, yourCBD and Delta-8 THC products for humansare drugs.We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products aregenerally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here,[4]new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your CBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans. There is no basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
YourCBD and Delta-8 THC products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.)
These products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes.Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effectfor your products.[5]The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
CBD-containing Drugs
Even if your“Pain Relieving CBD Cream,” “Pain Relieving Cream,” “CBD & Menthol Pain Freeze Roll-On,” and “Stella’s Baby Care Diaper Cream” products were considered nonprescription drugs, we note that a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. Nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not GRASE and are new drugs which require an approved application to be legally marketed. CBD is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act under which certain nonprescription drug products may be marketed without an approved new drug application. In particular, such a product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).[6],[7]
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your “Broad-Spectrum THC Free Organic Honey,” “CBD Fair-Trade Coffee,” and “CBD Infused Organic Tea” products appear to be conventional foods. It is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[8]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 321(s), and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 348. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “Broad-Spectrum THC Free Organic Honey,” “Fair-Trade Coffee,” and “CBD Infused Organic Tea” conventional food products contain an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409; therefore they are adulterated products within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Further, there is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of Delta-8 THC. We are not aware of any information to indicate that Delta-8 THC is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that Delta-8 THC is GRAS for use in conventional foods.
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for Delta-8 THC based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of Delta-8 THC in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from Delta-8 THC. Our review of published scientific literature identified potential for adverse effects on the central nervous and cardiopulmonary systems. In addition, studies in animals have suggested that gestational exposure to Delta-8 THC can interfere with neurodevelopment. Therefore, based on our review, the use of Delta-8 THC in conventional food does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
In addition, according to your product labeling, your “Delta 8 Chewing Gum,” “Delta 8 Peanut Brittle,” and “Delta 8 Syrup” products are foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.  Specifically, your website promotes your “Delta 8 Syrup” for mixture with “any drink” and recommends “something carbonated.” Your “Delta 8 Chewing Gum” and “Delta 8 Peanut Brittle” are types of products typically considered to be conventional foods. Your “Delta 8 Gummies” (all varieties) also appear to be conventional foods to which Delta-8 THC has been added.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to Delta-8 THC for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, Delta-8 THC added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Delta-8 THC is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website and your social media websites, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract,” “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets,” “CBD Infused Pet Shampoo,” and “CBD Infused Pet Paw Balm.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website and your social media websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:

These products are ""new animal drugs"" under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. §§ 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-1. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act 21 U.S.C. § 351(a)(5). The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[9]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i).  Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction, as described above. Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal foods. FDA’s regulations in Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations 570.30(a)-(c), 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c), describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal foods are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
To the extent that you market any of your products containing CBD as animal food, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, “Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract,” “Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract,” and “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets,” are animal foods to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your website and social media websites refer to these products being mixed into meals (“Ranch & Livestock Natural Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract” and “Canine Whole-Spectrum Hemp Extract”) or intended for consumption based on flavor labeling (“Feline Chicken Flavor Zero THC Hemp Extract” and bacon-flavored “Pet Essentials Joint Support Tablets”). Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).

[1]As stated in previous FDA warning letters, the use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations. For example, infants may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of infants to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.
[2]There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Proclamation on Declaring a National Emergency Concerning the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Outbreak (Mar. 13, 2020), available athttps://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/presidentialactions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/.
[3]CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug productEpidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex andEpidiolex.  (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) From FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex(R) in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect.  Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
[4]For example, under section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable conditions are met, including conformity with an applicable OTC monograph. However, your products could not be lawfully marketed under section 505G, because based on your claims regarding these products, including on your website labeling, your products are marketed for uses not considered nonprescription indications. Further, even if certain of your products, such as your “Pain Relieving CBD Cream,” “Pain Relieving Cream,” “CBD & Menthol Pain Freeze Roll-On,” and “Stella’s Baby Care Diaper Cream,” were marketed only for nonprescription indications, they would not meet the conditions under section 505G for lawful marketing without an approved application. For example, CBD—considered an active ingredient under 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2) due to its prominent featuring on your product labeling—is not an active ingredient in any OTC monograph under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
[5]Further, even if your products were marketed only for nonprescription indications, these products would be misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), because they would be nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act that do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section (see footnote 1) and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355.
[6]21 CFR 330.1(e) requires in relevant part that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered."" A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance). CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product.
[7]Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects and must be safe when used at the intended dosage. CBD has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks. For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf. It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your CBD products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events.
[8]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(s)], the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
[9]Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(s)(5), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(ii).

WARNING LETTER
February 24, 2022
WL # 619877
Dear Dr. Martins:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility MYA International, Inc., located at 3517 Main St Ste 304, Chula Vista, CA, on 8/30/2021-9/3/2021, 9/8/2021, and 9/10/2021. Based on the inspection and our subsequent review of product labeling collected during the inspection, FDA identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You can find copies of the Act and related regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your product labels for Hygly, Diapro-Z, Bioampixilina, Penalin, Colloidal Silver, Tea (Tea Cellular), Quiebra Piedras, Shark Cartilage, and Helper following this inspection. The claims on your product labeling establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims on your product labeling in your 2021 MYA International Catalog that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
HYGLY and Diapro-Z products:

Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Hygly, Diapro-Z, Bioampixilina, Penalin, Colloidal Silver, Tea (Tea Cellular), Quiebra Piedras, Shark Cartilage, and Helper are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Bioampixilina, Penalin, Colloidal Silver, Tea (Tea Cellular), Quiebra Piedras, Shark Cartilage, and Helper fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement cGMP Violations:
The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, even if your Hygly, Diapro-Z, Bioampixilina, Penalin, Colloidal Silver, Tea (Tea Cellular), Quiebra Piedras, Shark Cartilage, and Helper were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act.
The violations include the following:
1. For each dietary supplement that you manufacture, you failed to establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you did not establish specification for identity, purity, strength, and composition of your dietary supplement products.
Once you establish finished product specifications, you must verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition [21 CFR 111.75(c)].
We have reviewed your response dated September 24, 2021, and have determined that your response fails to correct the deficiency identified during the inspection. In your response you stated that you “will develop a Finished Product Evaluation Form (FPEF) to include product specifications” for each finished product. As an example, you provided an FPEF for the product Impo-Frigi. The FPEF you provided fails to satisfy the requirements for finished product specifications because this form indicates that the strength and composition of the ingredients Maca Root, Ginseng Siberian, Damiana Leaf, Saw Palmetto, Valerian Root, and Ginkgo Biloba in the dietary supplements will all be determined by input only. Input is not a scientifically valid method to determine strength at the finished product stage.
2. You failed to establish component specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b). Specifically, you did not establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the identity, purity, strength, composition and limits on contamination of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met. For example, you have not established such component specifications for:
The Echinacea purpurea, Golden Seal, Bee Porpolis 70%, and Parsley Leaf used to manufacture your finished dietary supplement product Bioampixilina.
The Burdock Root Powder, Sheep Sorrel, Slippery Elm Bark, Watercress, Rhubarb Root, and Cinnamon Chips/Powder in your finished dietary supplement product Tea.
The Magnesium Chloride in your finished dietary supplement product Magnesium.
The Slippery Elm, Psyllium Husk, Fennel Seed, Licorice Root, Rhubarb Root, and Calcium Citrate in your finished dietary supplement product Intestinal Cleanser Part A.
The Maca Root, Ginseng Siberian Root, L-Arginine, Niacinamide, Damiana Leaf, Saw Palmetto Fruit, Valerian Officinalis Root Powder, and Gingko Biloba in your finished dietary supplement product Impo-Frigi.
Before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). You must also ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
In addition, under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2), you must either conduct appropriate tests or examinations or rely on a certificate of analysis (COA) from the supplier of the component that you receive, provided that the COA meets specific requirements. To the extent you receive dietary ingredients from suppliers from which you rely on a COA, you may only rely on a COA if the following conditions are met: (A) you first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier's COA through confirmation of the results of the supplier's tests or examinations; (B) the COA includes a description of the test or examination method(s) used, limits of the test or examinations, and actual results of the tests or examinations; (C) you maintain documentation of how you qualified the supplier; (D) you periodically reconfirm the supplier's COA; and (E) your quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and re-qualification) of any supplier. We note that it does not appear that you have not qualified any suppliers by confirming the reliability of the COA.
We have reviewed your September 24, 2021 response and have determined that your response fails to correct the deficiency identified during the inspection. The documents that you purport to be component specifications, including those you provided for Echinacea purpurea, do not demonstrate that you have established specifications to ensure that specifications for the identity, purity, and strength of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met. For example, the document only states “Passed ID” for the identity specification for Echinacea, and the identity specification is not provided.
3. You failed to prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a), and for your products in which you did prepare BPRs, your BPRs failed to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, you informed us during the investigation that you do not have BPRs for your Colloidal Silver product, and the executed BPRs you provided to our investigator for Bioampixilina 500mg capsules, lot number 0721315; Tea (Tea Cellular or Cat’s Claw Tea), lot number 0821421; Magnesium Liquid, lot number 821429; Intestinal Cleanser Part A, lot number 0821520; and Impro-Frigi, lot number 0821536, were incomplete as several sections, including sections related to production, were left blank, unsigned, or undated.
We have reviewed your September 24, 2021 response, and we have determined that it fails to correct the deficiency identified during the inspection. You stated that you have discontinued the product 670 Sodirite and that you will create a batch record for the 454 Colloidal Silver product. You also responded that for the incomplete batch production records, you would be updating the current versions to include written procedures and documentation for all key processing operations including double signature during key process steps, weights and lot numbers of components, label evaluation and control, blending specifications, in-process checks-on-weights and physical defects, yield reconciliation, major equipment and processing line identification, and quality review and release. However, your batch record templates already have locations/blank spaces on the forms to monitor processes such as entering weights and lot numbers of components, perform label evaluation and control, record blending specifications, reconcile yield, identify major equipment and processing lines, and sign and date for quality review and release. Your forms have most of the batch production record structure in place; however, it is necessary to determine that the staff is now entering/handwriting the information on these forms to complete the batch records. Your response also did not include any examples of BPRs created or revised and fully completed by your staff for review, which documentation could help demonstrate that the proposed corrective action has been implemented.
4. You failed to identify all processing lines and major equipment used during manufacturing to indicate their contents, including the name of the dietary supplement and the specific batch or lot number and, when necessary, the phase of manufacturing, as required by 21 CFR 111.365(k). Specifically, during the inspection, the investigator noticed that the capsule filling machine contained an unidentified brown powder inside the hopper and did not have any identification to indicate what contents were inside the hopper, or the name and lot number of the dietary supplement being encapsulated.
We have reviewed your September 24, 2021 response, and we have determined that it fails to correct the deficiency identified during the inspection. In your response, you stated that you are planning on developing a procedure for manufacturing control that will include the identification of equipment, status, and identification tag for lines used in manufacturing. You stated that you plan to create line, usage, maintenance and cleaning logs for each line, and provided blank examples of an identification tag and log page. However, you did not provide supporting documentation that you have implemented these corrective actions.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your Magnesium, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, and Impo-Frigi products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101. In addition, even if your Tea, Penalin, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Quiebra Piedras, and Helper products were not unapproved new and misbranded drugs, these products would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements. Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Penalin, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Quiebra Piedras, and Helper products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
2. Your Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Penalin, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Quiebra Piedras, and Helper products are misbranded with the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because your product labels contain information in two languages but does not repeat all the required label information (including the nutrition information) in both languages. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
3. Your Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Bioampixilina, Helper, and Quiebra Piedras products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] because the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9. For example:
a. Your Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, and Helper product labels declare several dietary ingredients but fail to express the amount of (b)(2)-dietary ingredients using the units of measurement given in 21 CFR 101.9(c) as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B) or the amount of (b)(3)-dietary ingredients using a metric measure as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A). Furthermore, your Helper product label fails to use the allowed abbreviation for micrograms for vitamin B12 listed in 21 CFR 101.9(d)(7)(i).
b. Your Magnesium product label declares “magnesium chloride” as a dietary ingredient. The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient (e.g., the weight of magnesium rather than that of magnesium chloride) [101.36(b)(2)(ii)]. The source of the dietary ingredient must be declared either within the Supplement Facts (for example, ""magnesium (as magnesium chloride)"") or in the ingredients statement [21 CFR 101.36(d)]. Furthermore, the %DV must be based on the quantitative amount of magnesium and not on the magnesium chloride.
c. Your Intestinal Cleaner Part A product label fails to declare calories, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, and iron. The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients total calories, total fat, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, sodium, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, total sugars, added sugars, protein, vitamin D, calcium, iron, and potassium shall be declared when they are present in a dietary supplement in quantitative amounts by weight that exceed the amount that can be declared as zero in nutrition labeling of foods in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). Furthermore, the label bears an incorrect %DV for calcium based on the quantitative amount declared per serving.
d. Your Tea, Intestinal Cleanser Part A, Bioampixilina, and Diapro-Z product labels declare a proprietary blend but fail to indent the dietary ingredients under the term ""Proprietary Blend"" or other appropriately descriptive term or fanciful name. Furthermore, the labels fail to place the quantitative amount by weight specified for the proprietary blend on the same line to the right of that term, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2) and (3).
e. Your Impo-Frigi product label declares the (b)(2)-dietary ingredient niacin but fails to state the source of the niacin and the %DV, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii) respectively. Furthermore, the (b)(2)-ingredients must be listed first followed by a heavy bar and then (b)(3)-dietary ingredients, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6).
f. Your Helper and Hygly product labels fail to declare the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients in the order and format prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36. The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients must be listed first in the order prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) followed by a heavy bar and then (b)(3)-dietary ingredients.
g. Your Helper product label declares riboflavin as vitamin B2 and thiamin as vitamin B1. While these alternative names are acceptable synonyms for the listed vitamins, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2), the synonym must parenthetically follow the name of the dietary ingredient. Furthermore, the label declares niacinamide and vitamin B5 which are not the nomenclature specified in 21 CFR 101.9 or 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B) for niacin or pantothenic acid, respectively. Additionally, the label fails to correctly list the %DV for each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii) and 21 CFR 101.9(c) and fails to indicate a Daily Value has not been established for the (b)(3)-dietary ingredient bee pollen, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv). Lastly, the label fails to declare the source of the vitamins. The source of each dietary ingredient must be designated on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
h. Your Bioampixilina product label fails to set the title “Supplement Facts” in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1). Furthermore, your Bioampixilina, Penalin, Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Helper, and Quiebra Piedras product labels fail to present the nutrition information using the bolding, heavy bars, and other format requirements outlined in 21 CFR 101.36(e).
i. Your Bioampixilina product label fails to present the quantitative amounts of the dietary ingredients under the heading “Amount Per Serving” or “Amount Per 2 Capsules” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(A). Furthermore, your Penalin, Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleaner Part A, Impo-Frigi, Hygly, Diapro-Z, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, Helper, and Quiebra Piedras product labels use the term “Each Serving,” but this is not an acceptable name for the heading “Amount Per Serving.”
4. Your Hygly, Diapro-Z, Quiebra Piedras, and Penalin products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example,a. Your Hygly and Diapro-Z product labels declare “Prostate Powder” which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient.b. Your Penalin product is manufactured into capsules, but the product label fails to list each of the ingredients used to form the capsules.c. Your Quiebra Piedras product label declares chanca piedra, but the standardized common name listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce is phyllanthus. Furthermore, the correct Latin binomial name is Phyllanthus niruri.d. Your Helper product label declares Paba, but this is not the common or usual name for para-aminobenzoic acid.
5. Your Magnesium, Tea, Intestinal Cleanser Part A, and Colloidal Silver products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to correctly declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.7. The label fails to express the net quantity of contents in terms of avoirdupois measure (gallon, pint, etc.) with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the measure, followed by the metric units as required by 1453(a) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. § 1453(a)].
6. Your Tea, Impo-Frigi, Diapro-Z, and Bioampixilina products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
7. Your Magnesium, Tea, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, and Intestinal Cleanser Part A products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the label fails to declare the serving size as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i). Serving size must be expressed in common household measures as set forth in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and must be followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parenthesis (fluids in milliliters and all other foods in grams). Furthermore, serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Your Shark Cartilage product’s suggested dose is 2 capsules, but the serving size lists 1 capsule. The serving size listed should be 2 capsules and quantitative amounts of dietary ingredients should be adjusted accordingly.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We offer the following comments:
1. Your full street address is not declared on the several of the product labels as required by 21 CFR 101.5(d); however, the street address may be omitted if it is shown in a current city directory or telephone directory.
2. Your Magnesium product label’s information panel includes nutrition information intermingled with information considered intervening material [21 CFR 101.2(e)]. Examples of intervening material include lot number and expiration date.
3. Your Magnesium, Colloidal Silver, Shark Cartilage, and Quiebra Piedras products list the “Other ingredients” in the (b)(3)-dietary ingredient section within the Supplement Facts label. The “Ingredients” or “Other Ingredients” must be listed outside and immediately following the Supplement Facts label as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).
4. Your Tea product label misspells the dietary ingredient watercress, your Shark Cartilage product label misspells the dietary ingredient chondroitin sulfate, and your Impo-Frigi product label misspells the dietary ingredientGinkgo biloba. Furthermore, the lower-case letter “g” appears to be partially truncated in the dietary ingredients Ginseng and L-Arginine on your Impo-Frigi label.
5. Some of the text on your Diapro-Z product label’s Supplement Facts is illegible.
6. Your Bioampixilina product label’s statement of identity must be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the principal display panel [21 CFR 101.3(d)].
7. Your Penalin product label bears the statement “Special Garlic Preparation.” 21 CFR 101 does not allow for such a statement within the Supplement Facts label.
8. Your Bioampixilina product label’s servings per container should be “15” and not “15 capsules.”
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

Dear Ms. Greenberg:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.renasorganic.com in February 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for the products “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture”, “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “500 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg CBD Anti-Aging Beauty Cream,” “CBD Super Cider,” “CBD Super Food,” and “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD,” all of which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/RenasOrganic and www.instagram.com/renasorganic; these websites direct consumers to your website, www.renasorganics.com to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “500 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg CBD Anti-Aging Beauty Cream,” “CBD Super Cider,” and “CBD Super Food” products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). FDA hasalso determined that your “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD” product is an unapproved new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act.

Unapproved New Human Drugs
Based on our review of your website and your social media websites, your “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “500 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg CBD Anti-Aging Beauty Cream,” “CBD Super Cider,” and “CBD Super Food” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website https://renasorganic.com and your social media website https://www.facebook.com/RenasOrganic/ that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On the Blog post, “3 Reasons to Be Excited About CBD!” dated January 15, 2021:• “Cancer-Fighting Capabilities . . . recent studies have shown that CBD can act as a direct antitumor agent for a variety of aggressive cancers and can even prevent the spread of cancer cells in the body.”• “Potential for Neurodegenerative Disorders and Brain Injury . . . CBD has various neuroprotective effects that have shown effectiveness against neural cell damage related to various neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s. CBD consumption can limit or prevent the damage caused by the advancing disease and even slow down the progression of degenerative brain diseases. Studies are also being conducted to conclusively prove the benefit of administering CBD immediately after traumatic brain injuries or spinal cord injuries to prevent the release of harmful mediators that often lead to permanent brain damage in such scenarios.”
On the webpage titled, “CBD Oil: Can It Treat Opioid Dependency?” linked from your Facebook post dated October 10, 2020 (which states “Opioid addiction kills 130 people in the USA every day. The medical community believes that CBD can curb opioid dependence in the country.”):
• “CBD is being touted as a safer alternative to opioids in the market. Unlike opioids, CBD isn’t addictive and doesn’t have psychoactive properties. Preliminary studies show that CBD can reduce opioid cravings, and that it breaks the addiction cycle.”
• “Seeing how CBD effectively manages pain, many healthcare providers have started recommending it to patients suffering from chronic pain and undergoing chemotherapy.”
• “Prevents Relapse . . . According to preclinical studies, the therapeutic properties of CBD can reduce cravings for psychostimulants, opioids and hard drugs like cocaine. CBD also rewires the brain’s programming to lower the intensity of cravings, making it easier to break the opioid addiction.”
On the Blog post, “How CBD Can Help You Quit Smoking” dated August 27, 2020:
• “CBD can help you with smoking cessation. There’s mounting evidence that suggests that CBD can decrease the urge to smoke, until it disappears altogether.”
• “According to studies, CBD oil can help weaken habitual triggers and breaks the addictive association with time, allowing smokers to quit.”
• “Preventing Relapse . . . While there still isn’t enough research to confidently say that CBD oil can eliminate nicotine addiction, ongoing studies have proven that it can be used to prevent relapses when quitting cocaine and morphine.”
• “Combating Nicotine Withdrawal . . . CBD triggers the release of serotonin by reacting with 5-HT1A receptors in the brain (just like antidepressants) and prevents anxiety, stress and moodiness caused by quitting smoking.”
On the webpage titled, “CBD Oil: Can it Help ADHD Patients?” linked from your Facebook post dated October 23, 2020:
• “CBD is especially useful in releasing serotonin in the body to combat feelings of anxiety and stress. Increased levels of serotonin in the body help us feel more relaxed and boost concentration—this is why many patients believe CBD can treat ADHD.”
• “CBD is a much safer alternative to conventional ADHD treatment. It’s all-natural, and it reacts with our bodies inbuilt receptors to promote optimal functionality.”
On the webpage titled, “Curing Insomnia with CBD” linked from your Facebook post dated October 24, 2020:• “Anxiety and insomnia go hand in hand. People who suffer from anxiety usually struggle with insomnia. Treating anxiety through therapy, medication, or CBD can help people sleep better.”
On the webpage titled, “What is CBD?”:
• “At Rena’s Organic, I want you to share with you the truth about CBD and its amazing properties. That’s because I want you and your loved ones to have an alternative to risky and debilitating pills and opioids.”
On the Blog post, “How to Use CBD to Combat Holiday Stress” dated January 22, 2021:
• “Reduced Anxiety and Depression . . . Studies show that cannabidiol has anxiolytic-like and anti-depressant-like effects, which can help reduce anxiety and depression in many people. While more research is required to prove the therapeutic effects of CBD, there are several studies that suggest that CBD can help alleviate some symptoms of depression and make the condition easier to manage.”
On the webpage titled, “Using CBD Oil for the Symptoms of Fibromyalgia” linked from your Facebook post dated February 9, 2021:
• “CBD oil has helped countless patients gain relief from the debilitating symptoms of fibromyalgia.”
• “According to a 2020 review, CBD oil has proven to . . . reduce inflammation, and relieve chronic pain. CBD also helps with . . . anxiety, which can keep people from achieving a state of complete rest.”
On the product page for “CBD Super Cider”:
• “Curbs Cravings”
• “Helichrysum [an ingredient in CBD Super Cider] is a powerful compound that works on your Endo-cannabinoid system. It is know [sic] to be a potent:o Anti-depressanto Mood stabilizero Inflammation Fighter”
• “Orange Essential Oil [an ingredient in CBD Super Cider] may naturally relieve anxiety, . . . depression and inflammation of the body.”
Your “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1000 mg CBD Anti-Aging Beauty Cream,” “CBD Super Cider,” and “CBD Super Food” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
External Analgesic Drug Products
Based on the above labeling claims, “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” are topical products intended for use as external analgesics, among other uses. As described below, these external analgesic drug products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
As previously noted, in general, a drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), if it is not GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling; and in general, new drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” drug products.
“500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” are external analgesic drug products subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, which governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Under section 505G of the FD&C Act, certain nonprescription drugs without an approved application —commonly referred to as ""OTC monograph drugs""—may be legally marketed if they meet applicable requirements. In particular, topical products intended for use as an external analgesic are deemed to be GRASE and not a “new drug” if, among other things, they conform to the tentative final monograph (TFM) that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination for such drug issued under 21 CFR Part 330. We note that OTC topical external analgesic products were addressed in the TFM for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983) and subsequent rulemakings. The 1983 external analgesic TFM, in combination with subsequent determinations, was deemed to be a final administrative order by section 505G(b)(8) of the FD&C Act. However, your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products do not conform to the conditions of use specified in the final administrative order, because the products’ active ingredient, CBD, is not an active ingredient in such order (nor in any applicable final monograph or TFM).
Although CBD is listed as an inactive ingredient in the labels of your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products, the product labeling clearly represents CBD as an active ingredient, which is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (see 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2)). For instance, your product labels and website repeatedly highlight the use of CBD for various conditions (see above claims), include numerous references to CBD with images of cannabis plants; and prominently feature CBD on the principal display panels of all of your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products. CBD is not a permitted active ingredient under the 1983 TFM.
Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products, these products would still need an approved drug application to be legally marketed because they would not meet the requirements for marketing under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, these products would not meet the conditions under section 505G(a)(1), insofar as they would not conform with the general requirement in 21 CFR 330.1(e) that inactive ingredients must be safe and suitable.1A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance).2CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product. Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects3and must be safe when used at the intended dosage.4CBD, however, has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks.5It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events. Accordingly, CBD cannot be considered a safe and suitable inactive ingredient as required under 21 CFR 330.1(e). Consequently, if CBD is intended to be an inactive ingredient in your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” product, that product would not meet the general requirements for nonprescription drugs needed for legal marketing under sections 505G(a)(1). Thus, “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” do not meet requirements under section 505G of the FD&C Act, under which they would be deemed to be GRASE and not a new drug.
In addition, FDA is not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” are GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Moreover, there is no evident basis under the FD&C Act under which these products would be legally marketed without an approved application. Accordingly, “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).
Misbranded Human Drugs
Your “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture”, “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture,” “500 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream,” “1000 mg CBD Anti-Aging Beauty Cream,” “CBD Super Cider,” and “CBD Super Food” products are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Furthermore, your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products are also misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act because the labeling of these products is false and misleading for several reasons. First, the labeling for these products identifies CBD as an inactive ingredient but represents CBD as having purported active pharmacological properties such as pain relief, among others. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in these products, the prominent featuring of CBD on the labeling of your “500 mg Pain Relief Cream” and “1000 mg Pain Relief Cream” products causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, which deems a drug to be misbranded if its labeling is “false or misleading in any particular,” and under 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4). Under 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4), “[t]he labeling of a drug may be misleading by reason . . . [of] the featuring in the labeling of inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.”
301(ll) and Adulterated Foods
We note that some of your products appear to be promoted or labeled as conventional foods. For example, your “CBD Super Cider” product is promoted as having a “delicious taste” and that it will not “have that sickeningly, sweet taste that most drinks offer.” Additionally, your “CBD Super Cider” and “CBD SuperFood” products are labeled with a Nutrition Facts label. Your “300 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture”, “600 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture” and “1500 mg CBD Full Spectrum Oil Cannabinoid Tincture” products, which are taken sublingually, also bear a Nutrition Facts label. However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food, including animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public.6Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your “CBD Super Cider” and “CBD SuperFood” products are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.7
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website, www.renasorganic.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/RenasOrganic and www.instagram.com/renasorganic, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drug “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD” is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and marketing it violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.renasorganic.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/RenasOrganic and www.instagram.com/renasorganic, that establish the intended use of your “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD” as a drug include, but are not limited to, the following:
On your product webpage for “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD” at https://renasorganic.com/products/renas-organic-for-pets/:
• “Whatever ailment your pet is suffering from, CBD or Cannabidiol, has shown extremely promising results.”
On your blog post titled “4 Uses for CBD for Your Pets” at https://renasorganic.com/4-uses-for-cbd-for-your-pets/:
• “Small scale studies have shown that CBD can help calm anxious pets without compromising their health, so they’re easier to manage.”
• “Let’s look at some of the uses of CBD for your pets:
1. CBD as a PainkillerCBD is known for its anti-inflammatory properties that make it an effective painkiller for humans and animals. If your pet was injured in an accident, try massaging the effective area with potent CBD oils to reduce theinflammation and pain. . . .
2. CBD is an AnticonvulsantIt’s not very common, but pets can have seizures too. Seeing your pet have a seizure is the traumatizing, to say the least. If your pet has a condition that causes seizures or tremors, use CBD to reduce them. CBD is an anticonvulsant; it’s proven to be very effective at treating epilepsy and other similar conditions.
3. CBD for Anxiety and StressOwners struggling to manage an anxious pet can use CBD to calm them down. Both dogs and pets can suffer from anxiety in the same way humans do. If you notice that your pet hides in one corner of the house or gets aggressive when you’re trying to leave the house, you can use CBD to put them at ease. CBD relaxes animals by reducing stress and anxiety.
4. CBD as an AntiemeticIs your pet vomiting everywhere due to certain illnesses? Try giving them some CBD brands ; it’s a known antiemetic and can help control nausea and vomiting. Your “Rena’s Organic for Pets” website metadata includes the following tag:• “product_tag-dog-cancer-cbd”On your webpage titled, “What is CBD?” at https://renasorganic.com/what-is-cbd/:
• “Many pet owners are faced with watching their pets suffer from many of the same diseases that humans are inflicted with. There are more and more reports of animals being treated for these and other ailments successfully with CBD.”
On your January 12, 2021 Facebook post www.facebook.com/RenasOrganic:
• “If something is making your pet anxious or tense, use our organic CBD Pet Product to help soothe them:”
On your January 6, 2021 Instagram post at www.instagram.com/renasorganic:
• “Try using our CBD product for pets. It can help reduce anxiety and calm down your furry companions. #CBD #CBDProducts #CBDforPainRelief #CBDforAnxiety #CBDforArthritis #CBDforStress #StressRelief #Anxiety”
Your “Rena’s Organic For Pets 300mg CBD” product is a “new animal drug” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. This product is not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of this adulterated drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

121 CFR 330.1(e) requires that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity"".

3See, e.g., 21 CFR 314.3(b) and 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), which define an active ingredient as “any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man”. All other components of a finished drug product are considered inactive ingredients (see CFR 314.3(b), 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8)).
4See 21 CFR 330.1(e).
5For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf.
6CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
7Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Ms. Hull:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility, located at 102 North Main Street #445, Kooskia, Idaho, from December 6, 2021, to December 10, 2021. In March and April 2022, we also reviewed your website at the Internet address www.crsupplements.com and your Facebook page at www.facebook.com/pages/ category/Health---Wellness-Website/C-R-Supplements-857713577610642. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your website and Facebook page, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.crsupplements.com in March and April 2022, and has determined that you take orders there for your products Calcium, 4X Calcium 4X, Copper, Molybdenum, Potassium, Selenium, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Alkalize-U, CR-Oxy+, and Immune Boost Pack. FDA also reviewed your Facebook page at www.facebook.com/pages/category/Health---WellnessWebsitem/C-R-Supplements-857713577610642 in March 2022, which offers a direct link to your website, www.crsupplements.com. The claims on your website and Facebook page establish that your Calcium, 4X Calcium 4X, Copper, Molybdenum, Potassium, Selenium, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Alkalize-U, CR-Oxy+, and Immune Boost Pack are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing, or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims on your website, www.crsupplements.com, that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Calcium
“[Calcium] helps keep your blood stream and other body liquids alkaline, countering body acidity. Harmful bacteria, virus and other disease causers do not thrive in an alkaline environment.”
4X Calcium 4X
“… [C]ountering body acidity. As a result of good body pH, … Bad Bacteria will decline.”
Copper
“[Copper] influences how your body perceives pain because it is a necessary part of enkephalin production.”
Molybdenum
“Molybdenum is essential to the enzymes that change the sulfites into sulfates so they can safely and easily move out of the body. … Sulfites accumulate and can build up to toxic levels. When sulfites reach toxic levels:
o Allergy responses like itching, hives, and fainting can happen.o Trouble breathing is another possible sulfite response. Respiratory problems can range from wheezing to a full-blown asthma attack.”
“Your liver requires Molybdenum to neutralize harmful by-products of candida and mold exposure.”
Potassium
“A lack of Potassium … can result in muscle cramps.”
Selenium
“Replacing damaged … cells in the body with healthy ones depends on adequate amounts of available Selenium.”
Additionally, the webpage for your Immune Boost Pack product at www.crsupplements. com website and your Facebook social media account at www.facebook.com/857713577610642/photos/pb.857 713577610642.-2207520000../1548660671849259/?type=3&theater contain the following claim, pertaining to your products Silver, Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Selenium, Alkalize-U, and CR-Oxy+:
“Sorry, No Flu Shots Here! Try These Instead … Natural Flu Shots” [followed by an image of Silver, Calcium, Magnesium, Zinc, Copper, Selenium, Alkalize-U, and CR-Oxy+].
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Calcium, Copper, Molybdenum, Selenium, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Alkalize-U, CR-Oxy+, and Immune Boost Pack are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Calcium, Copper, Molybdenum, Selenium, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Alkalize-U, CR-Oxy+, and Immune Boost Pack fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility from December 6, 2021, to December 10, 2021, revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). Based on these violations, even if your Silver and Magnesium products were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The violations include the following:
1. Your firm failed to establish a specification for every point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, you have not established any written specifications for the components you use in your dietary supplement products. As required by 21 CFR 111.70, you must (among other requirements):
a. Establish specifications for each component you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(b)];b. Establish in-process production specifications for any point, step, or stage in the MMR where control is necessary to ensure that specifications are met for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements [21 CFR 111.70(c)(1)];c. Establish specifications for dietary supplement labels (label specifications) and for packaging that may come in contact with dietary supplements (packaging specifications) [21 CFR 111.70(d)];d. Establish specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(e)];e. Establish specifications for the packaging and labeling of the finished packaged and labeled dietary supplements, including specifications that ensure the specified packaging is used with the specified label [21 CFR 111.70(g)].Once you have established the aforementioned specifications, you must determine whether those specifications have been met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75, and you must make and keep records for established specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.95.
We received your January 4, 2022, response. Your response did not include evidence of any implemented corrective actions relating to this issue.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103 and 111.140(b)(1). Specifically, during the inspection of your facility, your firm’s Laboratory Technician and Co-Owner stated that you do not have written procedures for the responsibilities of quality control operations. Additionally, you do not make and keep written documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control personnel performed the review, approval, or rejection requirements by recording the date that the review, approval, or rejection was performed and the signature of the person performing the review, approval, or rejection; and documentation of any material review and disposition and follow-up, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2) and (b)(3) for the below:
a. Regarding your Silver product, Batch(b)(4), which was used in your Silver, Batch(b)(4), your percent yield, as calculated based on the actual and theoretical weights reported on your batch production record (BPR), is outside of your listed acceptable range of(b)(4). Your MMR identifies that if the percent yield is outside of your acceptable range, a reason for the excessive difference will be provided in the “Events table”; and if a reasonable explanation cannot be provided, an area Supervisor/Designee will be notified, and an investigation will bereferenced in the “Events table”. However, no reason or investigation was recorded in the “Events table”. Additionally, your BPR contains quality assurance verification signatures, despite containing incomplete records, as described further below.b. Your BPR for your Magnesium product, Batch(b)(4), used in your Magnesium product, Batch(b)(4), contains incomplete records, as described further below, and lacks quality assurance verification signatures.
Once you have established quality control written procedures, you must implement quality control operations into your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.65; including a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR, as required by 21 CFR 111.55. Quality control personnel must also ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR, as required by 21 CFR 111.105, and you must have documentation, at the time of performance, for the quality control personnel review and approval of release or rejection for any packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.127(h) and 111.140(b).
We received your January 4, 2022, response. Your response did not include evidence of any implemented corrective actions related to this issue. Although you provide an MMR and BPR containing quality assurance verification signatures for your Magnesium, Batch(b)(4), no written procedures establishing the responsibilities of quality control operations was provided. Additionally, your MMR and BPR are missing significant elements related to quality control operations, described in greater detail below.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a written MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, the MMRs for your Silver and Magnesium products address only certain portions of the manufacturing process and do not address bottling into individual units for end consumption. The MMRs associated with your Silver and Magnesium products provided to our investigators also have multiple production runs associated with them and do not provide for a determined batch size.
Under 21 CFR 111.205, you must prepare an MMR that (1) identifies specifications for the points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR, and (2) establishes controls and procedures to ensure that each batch of dietary supplement that you manufacture meets these specifications [21 CFR 111.205(b)(1) and (b)(2)]. In addition, each MMR must conform to the requirements as described in 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your MMRs for your Silver and Magnesium products fail to include:
a. The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)];b. A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient [21 CFR 111.210(e)];c. A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)];d. Written instructions as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h), including the following:i. Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [CFR 111.210(h)(1)];ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)];iii. Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)];iv. Special notations and precautions to be followed [21 CFR 111.210(h)(4)].
We received your January 4, 2022, response. Your response included an MMR/BPR for your Magnesium product, Batch(b)(4). This same MMR/BPR was also provided to our investigators during the inspection. The version of this MMR/BPR that was provided in your response continues to exclude requirements under 21 CFR 111.210, including specific items pertaining to 21 CFR 111.210(h).
4. You failed to prepare a BPR every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplements and to prepare a BPR that includes all required information, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, you provided our investigator BPRs that were used for multiple production runs of dietary supplements, rather than for individual batches. Additionally, your BPRs, which you stated to our investigator also function as the subject products’ MMRs, provided for your Silver, Batch(b)(4), and Magnesium, Batch(b)(4), include only limited information relating to the manufacture of bulk ingredients for these products. Your BPR’s for your Silver, Batch(b)(4), and Magnesium, Batch(b)(4), products are missing the following required information:
a. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)];b. The unique identifier that you assigned to each component (or, when applicable, to a product that you receive from a supplier for packaging or labeling as a dietary supplement), packaging, and label used [21 CFR 111.260(d)];c. The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)];d. Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e) and (g) [21 CFR 111.260(i)];e. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including:i. The date on which each step of the MMR was performed [21 CFR 111.260(j)(1)];ii. The initials of the persons performing each step, including:A. The initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(i)];B. The initials of the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure of each component used in the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(ii)];C. The initials of the person responsible for adding the component to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(iii)];D. The initials of the person responsible for verifying the addition of components to the batch [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(iv)].f. Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including:i. The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and, when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels [21 CFR 111.260(k)(1)];ii. An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)];iii. The results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements (including repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements), or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results [21 CFR 111.260(k)(3)].g. Documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel:i. Reviewed the BPR, including:A. Review of any monitoring operation required under 21 CFR 111 subpart E [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(i)];B. Review of the results of any tests and examinations, including tests and examinations conducted on components, in-process materials, finished batches of dietary supplements, and packaged and labeled dietary supplements [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(ii)].ii. Approved or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging [21 CFR 111.260(l)(2)];iii. Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch [21 CFR 111.260(l)(3)];iv. Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement, including any repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)(4)].h. Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)];i. Documentation at the time of performance of any reprocessing [21 CFR 111.260(n)].
We received your January 4, 2022, response. Your response included an MMR/BPR for your Magnesium product, Batch(b)(4). This same MMR/BPR was also provided to our investigators during the inspection. The version of this MMR/BPR which was provided in your response continues to exclude requirements under 21 CFR 111.260 including specific items pertaining to 21 CFR 111.260(j), 21 CFR 111.260(k), and 21 CFR 111.260(l).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, even if your Silver and Magnesium products were not unapproved new and misbranded drugs, these products would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements.Specifically, we identified the following:
1. Your Silver and Magnesium products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] in that the nutrition information (e.g., Supplement Facts label) is not in a correct format, as required by 21 CFR 101.9. Foods, other than infant formula, represented or purported to be specifically for children one (1) through three (3) years of age shall bear nutrition labeling for those age groups, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(j)(5). Your Silver and Magnesium products do not provide nutrition information for children between one (1) year and three (3) years of age. There are specific requirements for children under four (4) years of age and under two (2) years of age, per 21 CFR 101.9(j)(5).In addition, the product labels fail to list the serving size for each of the age groups indicated on the label, which includes 1 teaspoon (5 mL) daily for adults, and children under 4 years of age ¼-½ tsp. (1.2-2.5 mL), respectively. The products are for persons within two different groups, and the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).
2. Your Silver and Magnesium products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:
a. Your Magnesium product label declares magnesium at a quantitative weight of 1.75 milligrams (mg) per serving and at <1% of the Daily Value. However, if magnesium is not present or in an amount that can be declared as zero, in 21 CFR 101.9(c), it shall not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).b. Your Silver and Magnesium product labels lists the “Other ingredients” above the Supplement Facts label. The “Ingredients” or “Other Ingredients” must be listed immediately following the Supplement Facts label, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Amy R. Glynn, Compliance Officer, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021-4421. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Compliance Officer Glynn at 425-302-0411.

WARNING LETTER
March 28, 2022Dear Mr. Gear:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspected your facility, NDAL Mfg Inc., FEI 3011219618, at 80 Garden Court, Suite 100, Monterey, California 93940, from September 8 to 20, 2021.
This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
In addition, MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray, MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER, and MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(d) and (a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and (a). These violations are described in more detail below.
We reviewed your September 30, 2021, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.
During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
CGMP Violations
1. You firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).
Your firm utilizes Contract Manufacturing Organizations (CMOs) to manufacture your drug products, and you provided at least one of them drug components for use in drug manufacturing. Additionally, an agreement with one of your contractors stipulated that you are responsible for drug product release to the market. Your firm did not have a quality unit (QU) and failed to have adequate procedures to ensure that all drug products produced for your firm possessed appropriate quality attributes. For example, you failed to establish procedures for the approval of components provided to your CMOs, for investigating out of specification (OOS) results, and for evaluation of customer complaints. Furthermore, you were unable to provide the specifications being used by your CMOs to release your drug products commercially.
In your response, you stated that you intend to establish a QU, quality agreements with all your CMOs, and specifications. In addition, your firm hired a Quality Manager and employed the services of a third-party consultant.
Your response is inadequate. You did not provide a detailed risk assessment addressing the potential effects of releasing drug product to the market without established specifications to ensure their identity, strength, quality, and purity. In addition, there was a lack of detail for qualifying and overseeing your CMOs to ensure adherence to CGMP regulations. Furthermore, you did not provide a comprehensive assessment and remediation plan of your firm’s quality systems for them to function effectively.
Your firm’s quality system is inadequate. See FDA’s guidance documentQuality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulationsfor help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211, athttps://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
• An independent, comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is established with the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to:o A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriate.o Provisions for QU oversight throughout your and your contract manufacturers operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practices in functions that could affect drug quality.o A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decision.o Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all drug products.• A list of chemical and microbial test methods and specifications used to analyze each lot of your drug product before making a lot disposition decision, and the associated written procedures.
• A detailed description of your procedures and processes for conducting audits of your CMOs to ensure that they operate in compliance with CGMP.
• A detailed risk assessment to determine the impact of specifications for product released to the market. Specify actions you will take in response to the risk assessment, such as customer notifications and product recalls.
2. Your firm failed to thoroughly investigate any unexplained discrepancy or failure of a batch or any of its components to meet any of its specifications, whether or not the batch has already been distributed (21 CFR 211.192).
Your firm failed to perform a thorough investigation into the microbial contamination that occurred with ManukaGuard Allercleanse nasal spray lot 2010045, manufactured for your firm by your CMO,(b)(4). There is a lack of scientific justification to support your purported root causes. In addition, other potential root causes, such as components, equipment, or production environment, were not fully evaluated. Your firm was unable to provide an investigation from your CMO to determine potential microbial contamination in other drug products produced for your firm.
In your response, you stated that you intend to prepare a written record of your firm’s investigation into the microbial contamination of ManukaGuard Allercleanse nasal spray lot 2010045. We acknowledge that your firm voluntarily recalled ManukaGuard Allercleanse nasal spray lot 2010045. You also shared your plan to establish written procedures for investigating failures.
Your response is inadequate. You have not provided an adequate scientific justification that microbial contamination was limited to one lot. You failed to extend the investigation to other batches of the same drug product and to other drug products that may have been associated with the microbial contamination. In addition, you did not provide a retrospective and comprehensive review of complaints to determine if any other similar issues had occurred.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
• A comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, OOS results, and failures. Provide a detailed action plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, corrective and preventive actions (CAPA) effectiveness, quality unit oversight, and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted by your firm and your CMOs.
• A thorough retrospective and comprehensive risk assessment of all CGMP documentation associated with distributed finished drug product lots currently in U.S. distribution or within expiry, to evaluate the potential for microbiological contamination and how it may have affected the product quality of your drugs.
• A detailed remediation plan with timelines to address the findings of the risk assessment. Specify the actions you will take in response to the risk assessment, such as customer notifications and product recalls.
• A plan to perform testing of retain samples for all batches of drug products manufactured by your CMOs within expiry.
3. Your firm failed to assure that the drug product bore an expiration date that was supported by appropriate stability testing (21 CFR 211.137(a)).
Your firm has not established an adequate stability program. You lack data to demonstrate that the chemical, physical, and microbiological properties of your OTC drug products will remain acceptable throughout their labeled three-year expiry period.
During the inspection, when asked for stability data for your nasal spray products, you provided a report from an outside laboratory for one lot manufactured in 2016 that covered(b)(4)under accelerated conditions. Full shelf life studies were not conducted. Furthermore, the report does not contain predefined acceptance criteria, or a description of the container-closure system utilized, and the lot involved was not manufactured by your current CMO.
In your response, you committed to establishing stability specifications for your drug products and initiating a full shelf life study to cover the three-year product shelf life.
Your response is inadequate. You failed to provide stability protocols, including all relevant quality attributes and acceptance criteria, and you did not provide assurance that your test methods are stability indicating.
In response to this letter, provide:
• A comprehensive assessment of adequacy of product in market through shelf life for all lots of drug products manufactured by your CMOs that remain within expiry in the U.S. market.
• A comprehensive independent assessment and CAPA plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:o Stability indicating methodso Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permittedo An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are(b)(4)to the program to determine if the shelf life claim remains valido Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint)
• All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program
Test Results Out-of-Specification
For more information about handling failing, out-of-specification, out-of-trend, or other unexpected results and documentation of your investigations, see FDA’s guidance documentInvestigating Out-of-Specification (OOS) Test Results for Pharmaceutical Productionathttps://www.fda.gov/media/71001/download.
Use of Contract Manufacturers
Drugs must be manufactured in conformance with CGMP. The FDA is aware that many drug manufacturers use independent contractors, such as production facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. The FDA regards contractors as extensions of the manufacturer.
You are responsible for the quality of your drugs, regardless of agreements in place with your contract facilities. You are required to ensure that drugs are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act to ensure safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. See FDA’s guidance documentContract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreementsathttps://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download.
CGMP Consultant Recommended
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.
Unapproved New Drugs Violations
Examples of claims observed on the MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray, MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER, and MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE product labels and website that provide evidence of the intended use (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:
MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray
“Ingredients:Medical Grade Manuka Honey 12+ MGO 400…” [from your MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray product label]
“Medical grade Manuka Honey supports a strong immune system, reduces irritation in the throat and soothes coughs associated with hoarseness, dry throat, environmental contaminants.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“I was in the beginning of a sinus infection. I did not want to take antibiotics again. ONE USE after I bought it sitting in the store parking lot. I am 90% better now and slept like a baby last night.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“SUPPORTS CLEARING OF NASAL PASSAGES” [from your MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray product label]
“Breathe Easy” [from your MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray product label]
MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER“Ingredients:Medical Grade Manuka Honey 16+ MGO 600…” [from your MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER product label]
“Medical grade Manuka Honey supports a strong immune system, reduces irritation in the throat and soothes coughs associated with hoarseness, dry throat, environmental contaminants.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“Ever since I use [sic] ManukaGuard Sinus Cleanser I am not picking up any of the viruses floating around during flu season.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“Breathe Easy” [from your MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER product label]
MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE
“Ingredients:Medical Grade Manuka Honey 16+ MGO 600…” [from your MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY product label]“Medical grade Manuka Honey supports a strong immune system, reduces irritation in the throat and soothes coughs associated with hoarseness, dry throat, environmental contaminants.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“After days i [sic] hardly have any post nasal drip for the first time in years.” [from your website https://www.manukaguard.com]
“Breathe Easy” [from your MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY product label].
Based on the products’ labeled intended uses, MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray, MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER, and MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE, are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray, MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER, and MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in their labeling. Under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for MANUKA HONEY ALLERCLEANSE Nasal Spray, MANUKA HONEY SINUS CLEANSER, and MANUKA HONEY EXTRA STRENGTH NASAL SPRAY ALLERCLEANSE. Thus, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Your ManukaGuard Throat Soother Manuka Honey (8.8 oz), ManukaGuard Immune Support Manuka Honey (8.8 oz), and ManukaGuard Gut Health Manuka Honey (8.8 oz) products are labeled as dietary supplements. However, statements such as “[t]hroat soother, alternative to lozenges,” and “take ½ Tsp sublingual” were found in the labeling of these products. Only products that are intended for ingestion may be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act.
Drug Production Suspended
We acknowledge your commitment to temporarily suspend production of drugs for the U.S. market.
If you plan to resume production of drugs for the U.S. market, notify this office before resuming your operations.

WARNING LETTER
WL #614384
Dear Mr. Ta and Mrs. Chu:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, Princess Lifestyles, LLC., located at 418 E Valley Blvd. San Gabriel, CA 91776 on March 3, 9, and 26, 2021. In February 2022, we also reviewed your website at the Internet addresses www.princesslife.com, where you take orders for your products, including your TMAXX, PS Brain, Hemorlyn, Liver King, B.H. Care, Fucoidan Complex, Tibet Cordyceps Sinensis, Livelyn, Japan Reishi Mushroom, Goldenlife, Stomaisu, Lung Care, and Arthrolyn products. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your website, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drug
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet addresses www.princesslife.com, in February 2022 and has determined that you take orders there for your various products, including your TMAXX and PS Brain products. The claims on your website establish the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 USC § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
TMAXXOn your product webpage at https://princesslife.com/
“Regain control of your body’s metabolism by balancing the…regulation of…cholesterol with Tmaxx.”
PS BrainOn the product webpage at https://princesslife.com/
“Although studies [of PS, an ingredient in your product] in humans with Alzheimer’s disease were less dramatic, they still produced significant improvements in cognitive function. In patients with mild dementia, significant cognitive and behavioral enhancing effects were observed. Most studies have used a standardized PS that provides an elemental level of 100 mg taken twice per day.”
Your TMAXX and PS Brain products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product PS Brain is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your PS Brain product fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
Your dietary supplement products that you manufacture, package, label, and/or hold are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements in 21 CFR Part 111. Additionally, even if the product labeling for your TMAXX and PS Brain products did not have therapeutic claims that make these products unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would still be adulterated dietary supplements within section 402(g)(1) of the Act because these products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements. Following the March 2021 inspection of your facility, FDA issued a Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations addressing many of the issues discussed below.
1. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection, you told our investigator that you did not have any written procedures for quality control operations.
In addition, you failed to have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2) [see also 21 CFR 111.127(h)]. Specifically, your firm distributes the dietary supplements that are contract manufactured for you, but you had no records of a quality control review, approval, or rejection for your finished dietary supplement products. During the inspection, you informed our investigator that you do not review the documentation related to the finished dietary supplement products you receive from contract manufacturers to determine if those finished dietary supplement products have met specifications.
To the extent that you contract with other firms to manufacture your product that your firm releases for distribution under your firm’s name, your firm has an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution [72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34790 (Jun. 25, 2007)]. Although a firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations, it cannot contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplement it places into commerce (or causes to be placed into commerce) is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements. In particular, the Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section 402(g) for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements (see 21 U.S.C. 342(g) and 331(a)). Thus, a firm that contracts out some or all of its operations must establish a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.55). The quality control personnel must ensure that the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.105). Further, quality control must approve for release, or reject, any packaged and labeled dietary supplement (including a repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement) for distribution, and you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.127(h) and 111.140(b)(2)].2. You failed to establish component specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70. Specifically, you failed to establish an identity specification, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). For example, you have not established identity specifications for ingredients you purchase and then supply to your contract manufacturer for the products TMAXX and Livelyn.
3. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, to comply with 21 CFR Part 111.453 that include the requirements for holding components, dietary supplements, packaging, and labels, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.455. Specifically, your firm receives and holds components, finished dietary supplements, packaging, and labels prior to distribution. However, during the inspection, you told our investigator that you had not established and implemented written procedures for holding and distribution operations.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned dietary supplements, including the procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, to comply with 21 CFR 111.503.
During the inspection, you provided our investigator with your firm’s “Credits/Returns Policy,” dated March 1, 2011. This procedure does not include upon receiving a return, instructions for identifying and quarantining returned dietary supplements until quality control personnel conduct a material review and make a disposition decision in accordance with 21 CFR 111.510. Additionally, your firm’s “Credits/Returns Policy” does not include upon receiving a return, instructions for salvaging a returned dietary supplement following a material review and disposition decision to allow the salvage in accordance with 21 CFR 111.520. During the inspection, you informed our investigator that a returned dietary supplement received both within its expiration date and in suitable condition is restocked and redistributed to a different customer.
Moreover, your returned products log does not document that quality control conducts a material review and makes a disposition decision for the returned dietary supplements in accordance with 21 CFR 111.535(b)(2).
5. You failed to establish written procedures for the requirements to review and investigate a product complaint, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.553.
Specifically, you told our investigator that you do not have written procedures for product complaints that include the requirements that apply to the review and investigation of a product complaint.
In addition, you must ensure product complaints are reviewed and investigated as required by 21 CFR 111.560 and written records of product complaints that are related to good manufacturing practice and subsequent investigations are maintained as required by 21 CFR 111.570(b)(2).
Adulterated Dietary Supplement (non-CGMP)
In addition to being an adulterated dietary supplement within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act, your Stomaisu product is adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(A)] because it contains a dietary ingredient that presents an unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Specifically, your Stomaisu product label listsPinellia ternata, a dietary ingredient which contains ephedrine alkaloids, which presents an unreasonable risk of illness or injury under conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling, or if no conditions of use are recommended or suggested in the labeling, under ordinary conditions of use (21 CFR 119.1).Pinellia ternatais a plant listed in the final rule as one of the several species of plants that contain ephedrine alkaloids [Final Rule Declaring Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids Adulterated Because They Present an Unreasonable Risk, 69 FR 6788, 6793 (Feb. 11, 2004)]. Therefore, in accordance with 21 CFR 119.1, your Stomaisu product containingPinellia ternatais an adulterated dietary supplement within the meaning of 402(f)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(F)(1)(A)].
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your TMAXX and PS Brain products did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, your products would also be misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. In addition, your Fucoidan Complex, Tibet Cordyceps Sinensis, Hemorlyn, Livelyn, Japan Reishi Mushroom, Goldenlife, Liver King, Stomaisu, Lung Care, B.H. Care, and Arthrolyn products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Arthrolyn product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product label fails to declare the specific species of shellfish allergen sources as required by section 403(w) of the Act.
Section 201(qq) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(qq), defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients [section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)], or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen) [section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, your Arthrolyn product label declares “shells of shellfish” but not the specific type of shellfish present. A declaration of the “species” of shellfish for purposes of complying with Section 403(w)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)] should be made using the acceptable market name provided in FDA's The Seafood List. We note, however, that if a “Contains” statement is used to declare the source of the fish we would not object to just the type of Crustacean shellfish, e.g., “Contains shrimp” or “Contains crab.”
2. Your Tibet Cordyceps Sinensis, Hemorlyn, Livelyn, Japan Reishi Mushroom, Goldenlife, Liver King, B.H. Care, and Arthrolyn products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the labels fail to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
3. Your Fucoidan Complex, Tibet Cordyceps Sinensis, TMAXX, Hemorlyn, Livelyn, Japan Reishi Mushroom, Goldenlife, Liver King, Stomaisu, Lung Care, B.H. Care, and Arthrolyn products are misbranded with the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because your product labels contain information in two languages but does not repeat all the required label information (including the nutrition information) in both languages. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
4. Your Hemorlyn, Livelyn, and Lung Care products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) because the serving size declared on the labels are incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
The “Directions” for your Hemorlyn product states to take “2-4 capsules per day with meals,” but the serving size lists “2 Capsules.” The serving size listed should be four capsules.
The “Directions” for your Livelyn product states to take “1 to 3 capsules 3 times daily” but the serving size lists “1 Capsule.” The serving size listed should be three capsules.
The “Directions” for your Lung Care product states to take “2 capsules 3 times daily” as well as “Children 12 and older may take 2 to 4 capsules daily” but the serving size lists “2 Capsules.” The serving size listed should be four capsules.
5. Your Fucoidan Complex, TMAXX, Hemorlyn, Livelyn, Japan Reishi Mushroom, Goldenlife, Liver King, Stomaisu, Lung Care, and B.H. Care product are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify in English the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) for each of the botanical dietary ingredients in the products, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). We note “herb” is not a recognized plant part. Furthermore, we note if an entire or whole plant is used, that information must be noted.
6. Your Fucoidan Complex, TMAXX, Hemorlyn, Goldenlife, Stomaisu, Lung Care, B.H. Care, and Arthrolyn product are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual name (standardized common name) or Latin binomial of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h).
7. Your Fucoidan Complex, TMAXX, Hemorlyn, Goldenlife, Liver King, and Arthrolyn products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example,
The Goldenlife product’s Supplement Facts label lists thiamin as “vitamin B1” and riboflavin as “vitamin B2”. While these alternative names are acceptable synonyms for the listed vitamins, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(2), the synonym must parenthetically follow the name of the dietary ingredient.

The Liver King product’s Supplement Facts label declares “containing” prior to the listing of constituents in the Supplement Facts. There is no provision for the word “containing” prior to the listing of constituents in a dietary ingredient in the Supplement Facts label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(iii).
The Fucoidan Complex, TMAXX, Hemorlyn, Liver King, and Stomaisu products’ Supplement Facts labels each declare quantitative amounts in 1,000 or more milligrams (mg), The quantitative amount of other dietary ingredients must be expressed in appropriate units of measure of measure in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A); 1000 or more units must be declared in the next higher set of units (e.g., 1,000mg must be declared as 1g).

Product Catalog and Herbal Extract brochure, which you distribute with new orders of your products. In addition, we reviewed the product catalog, product pages, and newsletters posted on your website, www.bealydecker.com, in February 2022. Your website allows for your products to be added to an electronic shopping cart. Upon checkout, your cart then directs customers to contact your company to purchase products.

Examples of claims on your labels, catalog, brochure, and website that provide evidence your products are intended for use as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
Enzymes Plus
On the Enzymes Plus product label:
“The ENZYME PLUS formula uses specialized enzymes that break down excess protein such as SCAR TISSUE and FIBRIN in the blood vessels and internal organs, removes the protective protein coating on tumors, cancers and parasites, renders viruses and bacteria inert and reduces the immune systems ability to attack the body in auto immune diseases such as MS, LUPUS and RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. Combined with Magnesium (a natural blood thinner) and B-6, they help lower BLOOD PRESSURE, CHOLESTEROL and dissolve BLOOD CLOTS, thus aiding in the prevention and treatment of ARTHEROSCLEROSIS, STROKES AND HEART DISEASE … and DIABETES, while alleviating ANXIETY, CONFUSION, EPILEPSY, MIGRAINES, and INSOMNIA.”
On the Enzymes Plus product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“This formula uses specialized enzymes to break down excess protein on scar tissue and fibrin in the blood vessels and internal organs; removes the protective protein coating on tumors, cancers, and parasites; renders viruses and bacteria inert; reduces the immune systems ability to attack the body in auto immune diseases such as MS, Lupus and Rheumatoid Arthritis. Combined with Magnesium and B-6 to help lower Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and dissolve blood clots, thus aiding in the prevention and treatment of Atherosclerosis, Strokes and Heart Disease. It … aids in reducing anxiety, confusion, epilepsy, migraines and insomnia.”
From the product catalog on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
On page 13: “Enzymes Plus: … This formula uses specialized enzymes that helps the body break down excess protein on scar tissue and fibrin in the blood vessels and internal organs.

The other problem could be coming from Mercury that has settled in the joints from Dental amalgams or from medications, thus we recommend the Zeolite to clear heavy metals while treating arthritis. Since its discovery, there have been NO ADVERSE REACTIONS in mammals.”

CBD Oil Procana Spectrum
From the product catalog on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
On page 12: “CBD OIL Procana Spectrum ... helps relieve minor and some major pain ... Seems to aid in reducing inflammation.”
Your products Enzymes Plus, Artho Flex, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, Copper, Silver, Magnesium, Zinc, Adult Extra, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)(1)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your products Enzymes Plus, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Liquid Zeolite, Lung & Joint Congestion and Magnesium are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Enzymes Plus, Herbal Extract, Herbal Compound, Heart / Blood Vessel, Immune, Liquid Zeolite, Lung & Joint Congestion, and Magnesium products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
Based on our review of your website www.bealydecker.com, in February 2022, your Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)], because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.bealydecker.com that establish the intended use of these products as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
Equine Calmer
On the Equine Calmer product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“Useful for all larger animals and birds. ... Helps heal the nervous system and calms them in anxiety situations. Also effective as a natural anti-spasmodic used by horses for shows, gaming, and racing without hampering performance. No adverse side effect observed and generally passes drug testing.”
From the Holiday Greetings 2019 newsletter on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“Some horses have trouble getting so worked up before a barrel race that they can almost not get through the starting gate, but the Equine Calmer is very effective in helping them mentally calm down. I have had some thoroughbred racehorse trainers use this product in the night feeding with young horses first coming to the track for training because it helps calm their fears, relaxing them so they rest better. Sometimes when horses run hard they “tie up” with muscle spasms. The Equine Calmers usually relieves that too.”
Equine Artho-Flex
On the Equine Artho-Flex product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“Helps alleviate most chronic pain; one to three pounds will usually clear arthritis in most animals, especially horses.”
Calmer
On the Calmer product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“Effective, safe product for any kind of stress, anxiety or fear such as travel, new places, training, 4th of July and thunderstorms.”

Lung & Joint Congestion(also referred to as Lung & Joint and Lung & Joint Formula)
On the Lung & Joint product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“The L&J formula will usually stop bleeding in race or performance horses that are called “bleeders”. L & J opens the alveoli because the Lobelia & mullein relax the pressure & lung spasms of bleeders, asthmatics & horses with heaves.”
From the Holiday Greetings 2019 newsletter on your website, www.bealydecker.com:
“When we tried the Lung and Joint product on horses suffering from heaves, a form of equine asthma, the response was PHENOMINAL [sic]. We are seeing horses that could not stop coughing and no longer able to work, back out barrel racing and performing, living a full life with their owners. It is only used when they are having difficulties, and takes about 15 minutes to work. So far there has been no adverse side effects, so appears to be safe. We have even seen horses that are “bleeders” when they run, have little or no problems anymore. It is legal to use, even in racehorses.”
Liquid Zeolite
On the Liquid Zeolite product page on your website, www.bealydecker.com:

Your Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(v)] because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, new animal drugs must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or a listing on the Index of Legally Marketed Unapproved New Animal Drugs for Minor Species (“index listing”) under section 512, 571, or 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, § 360ccc, § 360ccc-1], respectively.
Your Equine Calmer, Equine Artho-Flex, Calmer, Herbal Extract, Immune, Lung & Joint Congestion, Liquid Zeolite, and CBD Oil Procana Spectrum products are not the subject of an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b, § 360ccc, § 360ccc-1]. New animal drugs that lack the required approval or index listing are ""unsafe"" and ""adulterated"" under sections 512(a) and 501(a)(5) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 360b(a), § 351(a)(5)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of adulterated drugs is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your products Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Lung & Joint Congestion did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs, your dietary supplement products that you distribute under your “Living Free” brand would be misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]:
1. Your Adult Extra product is misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(a)(1) and 201(n) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1), § 321(n)] in that the label of the product with added iron, fails to bear the required warning statement, as required per 21 CFR 101.17(e).
2. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size is not declared or is incorrectly declared on the labels. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2.
3. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the labels fail to declare the servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
4. Your Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product labels fail to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
a. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are manufactured into capsules, but the product labels fail to list the ingredients used to form the capsules.
b. Your Adult Extra product label declares the dietary ingredients P.A.B.A. and Biozyme but these are not the common or usual names for these dietary ingredients.
c. Your Adult Extra, Herbal Compound, Nerve & Muscle, and Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product labels declare trace mineral complex, but the labels fail to list the components of the complex. Furthermore, your Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, and Immune product labels declare enzyme complex but fail to list the components of the complex.
d. Your Adult Extra product label declares collagen, kidney, liver, heart, pancreas, and thymus. Your Digestion product label declares adrenal and pancreas. Your Nerve & Muscle and Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product labels declare collagen and thymus. Your Immune product label declares thymus, collagen, liver, kidney, heart, pancreas, and adrenal. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product label declares heart and collagen. Your Liver / Gall Bladder product label declares liver and kidney, and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label declares lung and collagen, but the label fails to identify the source of these ingredients, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 21 CFR 101.4(g).
e. Your Digestion and Immune product labels declare acidophilus, but this is not the common or usual name for this dietary ingredient. The label must state the complete Latin binomial name.
f. Your Liver / Gall Bladder product label declares stiklewort, but this is not a standardized common name noted in Herbs of Commerce.
5. Your Adult Extra, Immune, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Lung & Joint Congestion, and Heart / Blood Vessel products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] in that the product label fails to correctly declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7. Specifically:
a. Your Adult Extra 500 capsules, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate 500 capsules, and Heart / Blood Vessel 100 capsules product labels fail to present the net quantity of contents statement in letters and numerals in a type size established in relationship to the area of the principal display panel of the package and is not uniform for all packages of substantially the same size, as required under 21 CFR 101.7(i). Specifically, the net contents statement bears the numeral 5 handwritten over the typewritten 1.
b. Your Immune 1 pound and Lung & Joint Congestion product labels declare the net quantity of contents as 1 pound but fail to use the term “net weight”, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(2). Furthermore, these labels fail to express the net quantity of contents in metric units, as required by section 4(a)(2) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. § 1453(a)(2)].
6. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Artho Flex, Enzymes Plus, Herbal Compound, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. Your product labels fail to present nutrition information in the nutrition label using the title “Supplement Facts” and other format requirements outlined in 21 CFR 101.36(e).
b. Your product labels fail to place the subheading “Serving Size” under the heading “Supplement Facts”, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i) and fail to place the subheading “Servings Per Container” under the subheading “Serving Size”, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii), except that this information need not be provided when it is stated in the net quantity of contents declaration.
c. Your product labels fail to declare the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients in the order and format prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36 which requires the (b)(2)-ingredients to be listed first followed by a heavy bar and then the (b)(3)-dietary ingredients. Furthermore, your Enzymes Plus product label bears the dietary ingredient nattokinase handwritten below the ingredients statement, but nattokinase and its quantitative amount per serving should be located with and presented in the same format as the (b)(3)-dietary ingredients.
d. Your product labels fail to declare the % Daily Values for each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii) and fail to state “Daily Value not established” for each (b)(3)-dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv). Furthermore, for your Adult Extra product labels, there is no provision for use of the term “RDA” in the Supplement Facts label; it appears that the amounts listed under that term are the quantitative amounts per four capsules. In addition, your Adult Extra product label declares the %DV (as “%US”) for 5 mg of niacin as 100%, but the correct %DV is 25%. Likewise, the product label fails to correctly declare the %DV for manganese, chromium, molybdenum, and selenium.
e. Your Adult Extra and Enzymes Plus product labels fail to express the quantitative amount of each dietary ingredient using a metric measure, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).
f. Your Adult Extra product label declares “Niacinamide” as a dietary ingredient, but this should be listed as the source of niacin in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
g. Your Adult Extra product label declares potassium with an amount of 46 mg per serving which is 1% of the Daily Value. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
h. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product label fails to declare the sources of calcium, magnesium, potassium, and vitamin E and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label fails to declare the sources of vitamin E and vitamin C. The source of each dietary ingredient must be designated on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
7. Your Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I), § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the label fails to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).
8. Your Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because the label does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement”, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
9. Your Adult Extra, Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Herbal Compound, Immune, Liver / Gall Bladder, Heart / Blood Vessel, and Lung & Joint Congestion products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1) and 101.36(d)(1).
10. Your Digestion, Nerve & Muscle, Nerve & Muscle Plus Cetyl-Myristoleate, Enzymes Plus, Immune, Heart / Blood Vessel, Liver / Gall Bladder, Lung & Joint Congestion products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b).
11. Your Heart / Blood Vessel product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(u) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(u)] in that it purports to contain ginseng, but the purported ginseng ingredient is not from a plant classified with the genus Panax. Section 403(u) of the Act, added by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-171), provides that the term ""ginseng"" may only be considered to be a common or usual name (or part thereof) for any herb or herbal ingredient derived from a plant classified within the genus Panax. Specifically, your product contains an ingredient identified as Siberian Ginseng (another common name for Eleutherococcus senticosus as noted in Herbs of Commerce). That ingredient may not be declared under a name that includes the term ""ginseng"" because it is not from the genus Panax.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also have the following comment: your Digestion and Lung & Joint Congestion product labels misspell cayenne, your Herbal Compound misspells asafetida, your Immune (500 capsules) product label misspells echinacea, your Heart / Blood Vessel product label misspells L-carnitine, your Liver / Gall Bladder product label misspells chicory, and your Lung & Joint Congestion product label misspells lobelia.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Amy R. Glynn, Compliance Officer, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021-4421. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Compliance Officer Glynn at 425-302-0411.

Your social media website https://www.facebook.com/GlennBurkettBeautyFitnessHealth/ also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of your Colloidal Silver 1400ppm1400pm Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, and Daily 108 products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
• “I developed corona virus working at my job…I got Colloidal Dilver [sic] 1400 ppm, sinus spray 750 ppm, probiotic good bacteria and Daily 108 vitamins. I started feeling better after 3 days, Fever went down. The symptoms begin to subside” [May 21, 2020 Facebook Post]
Generally, a drug product is a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), unless it is generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an FDA-approved application, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, Silver Eye Drops, Daily 108, Daily Detox, Digest Foods Capsule, Mellow Life, Candida Kit, Cardiovascular Kit, Manuka CBD Silver Spray and Diabetes Kit products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, Silver Eye Drops, Daily 108, Daily Detox, Digest Foods Capsule, Mellow Life, Candida Kit, Cardiovascular Kit, and Diabetes Kit fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Further, the Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper, Colloidal Silver 1400 Spray, Silver 750 Sinus Spray, and Silver Eye Drops products all contain colloidal silver as an active ingredient and are made available for purchase over-the-counter (OTC) without a prescription. Nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application are subject to section 505G of the Act. Specifically, OTC colloidal silver drug products fall under section 505G(a)(5), because the Agency has established, in a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330, according to that no colloidal silver-containing OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective [21 CFR 310.548]. Further, 21 CFR 310.548 states that any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients “that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of [the Act] for which an approved application . . . is required for marketing” and that, in the absence of an approved application, “such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the [A]ct”Act [21 U.S.C. 352].
To the extent that your colloidal silver products are subject to section 505G, they are also misbranded under section 502(ee) of the Act.
Your Silver Eye Drops product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result.
In addition, your Silver 750 Sinus Spray product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because intranasal drug products may be rapidly absorbed through the highly vascularized nasal mucosa directly into systemic blood circulation, where they may exert undesirable systemic effects such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure. If toxic substances are introduced directly into the nose, harmful local effects such as bleeding, ulceration, or nasal septal perforation may occur.
Unapproved Animal Drug Products
We note that you also promote your Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper drugs for animal use. For example, your webpages https://glennburkettwellness.com and https://www.gb1com.com. In the “Suggested Use” section on the label depicted on your product page for your Colloidal Silver 1400 ppm Dropper product contains directions for pets and the front of the label contains an image of a dog and cat.

1Information on your website and social media account suggests that you may intend to market your Silver 750 Sinus Spray and Silver Eye Drops products as dietary supplements. For example, you display pictures of the labels of these products on your website that include “dietary supplement” on the label. However, these products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)]. The Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your product page for Silver 750 Sinus Spray, includes a statement, “Suggested use: Place applicator in nostril, squeeze container and inhale.” Your product page for Silver Eye Drops includes a statement, “Silver Eye Drops,” and “Supports immune response to infection/dry eyes.” In addition, on your Facebook page, you include a video where you perform a hand gesture of applying your Silver Eye Drops product in the eye (see: https://www.facebook.com/GlennBurkettBeautyFitnessHealth/posts/2094433670606560).
2There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. Secretary of Health and Human Services, Determination that a Public Health Emergency Exists (originally issued Jan. 31, 2020, and subsequently renewed), available at https://www.phe.gov/emergency/news/healthactions/phe/Pages/default.aspx. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Dr. Summerland:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your dietary supplement manufacturing facility located at 21624 Sertz Road, Index, Washington, on May 3, 4, and 12, 2021. During the inspection, we identified serious violations of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111), Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements. These violations cause the dietary supplement products manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 United States Code (U.S.C.) § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. In addition, the Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement product that you manufacture is misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page atwww.fda.gov.
We received an e-mail correspondence from you dated May 31, 2021, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
Your significant violations of CGMP requirements are as follows:
1. You failed to establish the required specifications for points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). You do not have written specifications to ensure the consistent production of your finished dietary supplements. Specifically, for your Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement capsules, lot #06821-6:
a. For your components:i. You failed to establish an identity specification, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1).ii. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement manufactured using the components are met, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2).iii. You failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required in 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).b. You failed to establish in-process specifications for any point, step, or stage in the MMR where control is necessary to help ensure that specifications are met for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(c)(1). Included in the manufacture of the Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement is the(b)(4)and(b)(4)of the wormwood powder and aloe powder. A(b)(4)inspection is performed on the herb(s) after(b)(4)the blend of wormwood powder and aloe powder; however, an acceptance criterion related to the(b)(4)of the(b)(4)blend (e.g.,(b)(4)) does not ensure that specifications are met for the composition of the dietary supplement.c. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminants that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
We received and reviewed your revised specification sheets for the dietary ingredients, wormwood and aloe, and for the Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement submitted with your May 31, 2021, written response to the inspection and have the following comments:
The specifications were revised to include identification by microscopic examination with an acceptance criterion of “(b)(4),” and the purity strength specification states “(b)(4).” The identity specification is inadequate in that the microscopic specification fails to include characteristics that will allow you to confirm the identity of the ingredient at issue, such as specific microscopic characteristics that should be observed for comparison to the standard. We are also unable to evaluate the sufficiency of your “Purity/Strength” standard on your revised specification sheet, which states, “(b)(4),” as this specification does not provide the specific portion or percentage that is wormwood or aloe powder, nor does it provide the specific concentration that is expected for each of the powders. The documentation you provided fails to provide a specification for composition for the individual wormwood powder and aloe powder.
Further, you included microscopic examination in your revised specification sheets in addition to organoleptic and macroscopic methods to identify the botanical powder and provided photos of two products showing a comparison of their physical structures under the microscope at different forms (whole leaf, rough cut, and finer cut). Microscopic analyses may be an appropriate identity test for whole or coarsely cut botanical parts, but it may not be an appropriate identity test for powdered or extracted botanicals because of decreased reliability, or in those instances where misidentification of botanicals is known to occur [Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, 72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34852 (June 25, 2007)]. The physical characteristic of a plant significantly decreases as the plant is cut into a finer size or powder, as evidenced in the photos you provided.
Your component and finished product specifications regarding limits of contamination are inadequate because you did not specify which heavy metals are subject to the specification (component) or are not established (finished product).
Your finished product specification is further inadequate in that identity cannot be determined by verification of input as it does not provide a specific physical or qualitative property that can be used to confirm identity, nor does it include a numeric or quantitative limit for comparison; purity as a function of no additives or flow agents does not provide the specific portion or percentage that is wormwood and aloe powders; strength as an amount of dietary ingredient cannot be adequately evaluated because the method by which the strength can be verified was not provided; and composition as a statement of a blend of OG Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) leaf and cape aloes (Aloes ferox) leaf powders in “00” gelatin capsules does not provide the percent of wormwood and aloe powders comprised in the blend.
Further, you have not established specifications for the empty hard-shell gelatin capsule #00 ((b)(4)) used in the manufacture of your dietary supplement capsules.
Finally, you provided a label proof that includes specifications (e.g., die number, dimensions stock, and unwind directions). To the extent that you intend to use the label proof to satisfy the requirement for label specifications under 21 CFR 111.70(d), we note that it is unclear if this is the label used in all labeling operations or if the specifications provided are the official labels. Furthermore, the label proof does not have approval by your quality unit documented on the record.
Moreover, your response dated May 31, 2021, did not include any interim corrective action to ensure that the dietary supplements that you manufacture and distribute are what they purport to be and are free from contamination. Although you stated during the inspection that it would take approximately six months to complete the majority of your product specifications, and longer than six months for those products that you order only once or twice a year, you did not provide additional information about this timeline in your response or explain why it would take six months, nor did you specify corrections that you would make in the meantime.
Once you have established the specifications identified above, you must verify that the specifications are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75, and you must make and keep records of the specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1). Your Quality Control Personnel must approve specifications, among other things, as required by 21 CFR 111.105(a).
2. You failed to prepare and follow a master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, which includes all required information, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a) and 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, during the inspection, when the FDA investigator requested information about your MMRs, you provided a document titled “Master Manufacturing Record,” dated March 8, 2021, for the manufacture of the Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement. The document lacked the following information that must be included in an MMR, as required in 21 CFR 111.210:
a. The strength and concentration of each dietary ingredient for each batch size [21 CFR 111.210(a)];b. A complete list of components to be used [21 CFR 111.210(b)];c. An accurate statement of the weight or measure of each component to be used [21 CFR 111.210(c)];d. The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)];e. A statement of any intentional overage amount of a dietary ingredient [21 CFR 111.210(e)];f. A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)];g. A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)]; andh. The following written instructions:i. Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled, as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(1)];ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)];iii. Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)]; andiv. Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met [21 CFR 111.210(h)(5)].
We received your revised MMRs submitted with your May 31, 2021, written response to the inspection. Our review of these documents indicates they are inadequate because they continue to lack the required information for an MMR as listed above.
3. You failed to prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplement, which includes all required information, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a) and 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, the BPR you provided for your Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement lacked the following information that must be included in a BPR, as required by 21 CFR 111.260:
a. The identity of equipment used in producing the batch [21 CFR 111.260(b)];b. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs where the information is retained [21 CFR 111.260(c)];c. The identity and weight or measure of each component used [21 CFR 111.260(e)];d. A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at the appropriate phases of processing [21 CFR 111.260(f)];e. The results of any testing or examination performed during the batch production, or a cross-reference to such results [21 CFR 111.260(h)];f. Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications for identity, purity, strength, composition, and limits on contamination and for packaging and labeling [21 CFR 111.260(i)];g. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the date on which each step of the master manufacturing record was performed and the initials of the persons performing each step [21 CFR 111.260(j)(1)];h. Documentation, at the time of performance, of the manufacture of the batch, including the initials of the person responsible for weighing or measuring each component used in the batch, the person responsible for verifying the weight or measure, the person responsible for adding the component to the batch, and the person responsible for verifying the addition of components [21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)];i. Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including the unique identifier you assigned to packaging and labels used, an actual or representative label of the finished product as specified in the master manufacturing record, and the results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements [21 CFR 111.260(k)]; andj. Documentation, at the time of performance, that the quality control personnel reviewed the batch production record, approved, or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging, approved, and released the batch or rejected the batch for distribution, and approved and released or rejected the packaged and labeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)].
We are unable to adequately assess your corrective action submitted in your May 31, 2021, response for this observation because you did not provide documentation for review that demonstrates you are preparing a BPR that includes all required information for every manufactured batch of dietary supplement.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any processing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, you have no written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any processing.
Once you have established your quality control written procedures, you must implement quality control operations in your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.65.
We have reviewed your revised Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) submitted with your May 31, 2021, written response. Section IV Quality Control/QA of your SOP includes the duties of quality control, duties of quality assurance, and inspection of materials. However, it does not include written procedures documenting how you conduct a material review, make a disposition decision, and approve or reject any reprocessing related to ingredients, in-process material, finished products, and packaging and labeling components.
5. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements for product complaints, as required by 21 CFR 111.553. Specifically, you have no written procedures for product complaints.
We have reviewed your revised SOPs submitted with your May 31, 2021, written response. Section I Materials of your SOP includes a subsection on product returns which describes your complaint procedure. It states that complaints are addressed on an individual basis, and if a concern about a specific lot of herbs is warranted, customers who received the lot are notified as noted in your recall plan. Your written procedure is inadequate in that it does not provide sufficient information to determine whether a qualified person will review and investigate product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury; whether quality control personnel will review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint and review and approve the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed; and whether the required review and investigation of the product complaint by a qualified person, and the review by quality control personnel about whether to investigate a product complaint, and the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed, must extend to all relevant batches and records, as required by 21 CFR 111.553 and 21 CFR 111.560.
Note that after you have established such procedures, you must make and keep a written record of every product complaint, as required by 21 CFR 111.570(b)(2).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
6. Your Wormwood/Aloes dietary supplement is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] in that the labels fails to identify the appropriate part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example:
a. The label indicated thatArtemisia absinthiumis derived from the leaf part of the plant, however, the specification sheet indicated that the botanical ingredient is derived from the aerial parts, which include the entire plant parts that grow above the ground.b. The label indicated thatAloe feroxis derived from the leaf part of the plant, however, the supplier specification sheet indicated it is derived from the juice or resin from leaves.
The plant part declared on the product label must be consistent with the actual plant part identity as indicated on the specification sheet.
7. Your Wormwood/Aloes product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. The title, ""Supplement Facts,"" is not larger than all other print in the panel [21 CFR 101.36(e)(1)];b. The title and all headings are not bolded to distinguish them from the other information [21 CFR 101.36(e)(1)];c. The Serving Size is not placed under the ""Supplement Facts"" heading and not aligned on the left side of the nutrition label [21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)]; andd. There are no spaces between text lines and the letters within the panel touch one another and, in general, the label is not offset from the remainder of the label in a box and does not have the bolding, heavy bars, etc. [21 CFR 101.36(e)].
8. Your Wormwood/Aloes product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically,Artemisia absinthiumandAloe feroxare not the standardized common names for these dietary ingredients. Furthermore, the product specification sheet and master manufacturing records indicate the product’s dietary ingredients are powdered extracts, but the product label fails to state the dietary ingredients are extracts.
9. Your Wormwood/Aloes product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7. Specifically, your label states that “This package contains approximately” 300 “00” capsules. “Approximately” is not provided for in 21 CFR 101.7.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

United States
Dear Mr. Robinson:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspected your drug manufacturing facility, Sanitor Corporation, FEI 3005871025, at 8400 W. Cerritos Avenue, Stanton, California, from May 25, 2021, to June 3, 2021.
This warning letter summarizes significant violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR parts 210 and 211).
Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B).
Your firm manufactures(b)(4)and(b)(4)drug products to bleach and/or lighten the skin. These products are unapproved new drugs in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food & Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act,) 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d). In addition,(b)(4)is a misbranded drug under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.
In addition,(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)),(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)), and(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)) are not listed with FDA as required by section 510(j) of the FD&C Act. Failure to properly list a drug product is prohibited and will render a drug misbranded under 21 U.S.C. 331(p), 352(o). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.
We reviewed your June 24, 2021, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence. Your response is inadequate because it did not provide sufficient detail or evidence of corrective actions to bring your operations into compliance with CGMP.
During our inspection, our investigators observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
1.    Your firm’s quality control unit failed to exercise its responsibility to ensure drug products manufactured are in compliance with CGMP, and meet established specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.22).
Inadequate investigations/Lack of process control
You contract manufacture over-the-counter drug products including benzalkonium chloride-based hand sanitizer.1Multiple batches of hand sanitizer drug product failed microbial total plate count (TPC) testing with results of Too Numerous to Count (TNTC). Your quality unit (QU) failed to adequately investigate and identify the root cause for the microbial contamination in your hand sanitizer drug product. Instead of conducting a thorough investigation and implementing corrective action to prevent contamination, your QU:
•    Approved the addition of an antimicrobial preservative to batches that initially failed microbial TPC testing, and were then released for distribution by your customer; and•    Approved the addition of an antimicrobial preservative to batches not yet tested for microbial TPC so that they would yield a passing result, and were released for distribution by your customer.
Additionally, stability samples of a batch of hand sanitizer drug products (previously released without the addition of the preservative) failed the three-month stability test interval for microbial TPC with a result of TNTC. You stated that you notified the customer and recommended a voluntary recall of the drug product. Your customer declined to do so and informed you that the lot was sold and consumed. No further actions were taken.
In your response, you stated that you have performed a management review with your consultant and determined that your procedures were “inadequately robust and/or detailed.” Your response is inadequate in part, because you did not provide a thorough investigation into the microbial failures. You also did not provide adequate details of your consultant’s review and remedial actions. Further, your QU did not exercise its duties and oversight to ensure that future investigations are thorough, including root cause determination and appropriate corrective action strategies.
In response to this letter, provide the following:•    A comprehensive, independent assessment of your overall system for investigating deviations, discrepancies, complaints, out-of-specification results, and failures. Provide a detailed action plan to remediate this system. Your action plan should include, but not be limited to, significant improvements in investigation competencies, scope determination, root cause evaluation, corrective action and preventive action (CAPA) effectiveness, QU oversight, and written procedures. Address how your firm will ensure all phases of investigations are appropriately conducted.
•    Complete investigations into all batches with potential objectionable microbial contamination or an out-of-specification  microbiological result (whether or not later invalidated). The investigations should detail your findings regarding the root causes of the contamination.
•    An independent assessment and remediation plan for your CAPA program. Provide a report that evaluates whether the program includes effective root cause analysis, ensures CAPA effectiveness, analyzes investigation trends, improves the CAPA program when needed, implements final QU decisions, and is fully supported by executive management.
Approving shipment of drug products before adequate review
Your QU approved drug products for distribution without complete finished product testing. For example, your firm shipped hand sanitizer batch(b)(4)to your customer on June 1, 2020. However, the analytical results were only available as of on June 3, 2020, and the microbiological results were received on June 8, 2020. Your QU approved the certificate of analysis on June 3, 2020, before receiving the microbiological test results and after the batch was shipped to your customer.
In your response, you stated that you would “transfer” unreleased finished products to your customers under a verbal agreement that the products would not be distributed into interstate commerce until the batch was approved and released by your QU. This practice is unacceptable and increases the risk that drug products that do not meet their quality attributes are distributed to consumers. Complete testing of each batch of drug product before release is required to determine if the drug products you manufacture meet appropriate specifications.
In response to this letter, provide an independent retrospective review of all hand sanitizer drug products you manufactured to ensure no failing products were distributed. If the review reveals substandard quality drug products were distributed, take rapid corrective actions, such as notifying customers and product recalls.
Inadequate stability program
Your QU lacked adequate quality oversight over your stability program. For example, you failed to follow yourPackage Compatibility Test Programprocedure, and place(b)(4)of each product on(b)(4)stability testing to represent the product and process for your hydroquinone(b)(4)drug products.
In your response, you indicated that the formulation for your hydroquinone(b)(4)drug products is packaged into(b)(4)different products and that all such products were initially placed on stability. Further, you noted that because the formulation, the packaging size, and the material of construction is the same for the(b)(4)products, you are using a bracketing design to conduct the(b)(4)stability testing. However, your response indicated different container closure system designs. Therefore, the bracketing design does not appear scientifically justified. Additionally, this change to add a bracketing approach to your stability program for these products was implemented without adequate change control.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
•    A comprehensive, independent assessment and CAPA plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:o    Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before distribution is permittedo    Stability-indicating methodso    An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if the shelf-life claim remains valido    Detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint)
•    All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program.
•    A list of expiration dates, with associated justification, for all drug products (e.g., 3 years of real time stability data).
Inadequate quality oversight over documentation
During the review of a batch record for your(b)(4)hydroquinone(b)(4)drug product, batch(b)(4), our investigators noted that production activities were not recorded contemporaneously. For example, the batch record documented that one employee performed multiple manufacturing steps, such as measuring containers and bulk reconciliation on two separate dates, and a second employee documented the verification of the activities. However, the second employee (verifier) stated to our investigator that they were not at work when these steps were documented as being performed. Your QU oversight does not provide adequate assurance that manufacturing records are accurate, and that production was performed as documented.
In your response, you acknowledge that good documentation practices were not followed. You also stated that you performed training of all personnel. Your response is inadequate. Your quality system has not adequately ensured the accuracy and integrity of the data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. Without accurate records, you cannot assure appropriate decisions regarding batch release, product stability, and other matters that are fundamental to the ongoing assurance of quality.
In response to this letter, provide a complete assessment of documentation systems used throughout your manufacturing and laboratory operations to determine where documentation practices are insufficient. Include a detailed CAPA plan that comprehensively remediates your firm’s documentation practices to ensure you retain attributable, legible, complete, original, accurate, contemporaneous records throughout your operation.
The examples above demonstrate the fundamental failure of your QU to perform its roles and responsibilities, but not limited to, oversight over process control, investigation handling, batch review and disposition, and appropriate control of data.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
•    A comprehensive assessment and remediation plan to ensure your QU is given the authority and resources to effectively function. The assessment should also include, but not be limited to:o    A determination of whether procedures used by your firm are robust and appropriateo    Provisions for QU oversight throughout your operations to evaluate adherence to appropriate practiceso    A complete and final review of each batch and its related information before the QU disposition decision
•    Oversight and approval of investigations and discharging of all other QU duties to ensure identity, strength, quality, and purity of all products. Also, describe how top management supports quality assurance and reliable operations, including but not limited to, timely provision of resources to proactively address emerging manufacturing/quality issues and to assure a continuing state of control.
On September 20, 2021, FDA held a teleconference with you and your consultant. We recommended that you consider removing all of your firm’s hand sanitizer drug products within expiry that were manufactured under the conditions referenced in this letter. On September 21, 2021, you voluntary recalled certain batches of hand sanitizer drug products. On September 22, 2021, FDA notified the public of your lack of adequate controls to prevent microbial contamination at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-updates-hand-sanitizers-consumers-should-not-use.
See FDA’s guidance document Quality Systems Approach to Pharmaceutical CGMP Regulations for help implementing quality systems and risk management approaches to meet the requirements of CGMP regulations 21 CFR, parts 210 and 211 at https://www.fda.gov/media/71023/download.
2.    Your firm failed to establish laboratory controls that include scientifically sound and appropriate specifications, standards, sampling plans, and test procedures designed to assure that components, drug product containers, closures, in-process materials, labeling, and drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity (21 CFR 211.160(b)).
You released and distributed multiple reworked batches and newly reformulated batches of your hand sanitizer drug product, without demonstrating the antimicrobial effectiveness testing of the preservative added to the product formulation. Specifically, a batch of your hand sanitizer drug product failed microbial TPC during bulk stage release testing with a result of TNTC. You reworked this batch by adding an antimicrobial preservative. Your deviation report stated that preservative adds microbial stability while not affecting the benzalkonium assay.
In your response, you stated that you submitted a sample to your contract testing lab to perform antimicrobial effectiveness testing on your hand sanitizer drug product and the results provide evidence of the effectiveness of the addition of the preservative to the formulation.
Your response is inadequate. You did not provide complete laboratory data from your contract laboratory. As per USP <51>, antimicrobial preservatives should not be used as a substitute for good manufacturing practices or solely to reduce the viable microbial population of a nonsterile drug product.In your response to this letter, provide the following:
•    A comprehensive, independent assessment of the design and control of your firm’s manufacturing operations, with a detailed and thorough review of all microbiological hazards.
•    A detailed risk assessment addressing the hazards posed by distributing drug products with potentially objectionable contamination. Specify actions you will take in response to the risk assessment, such as customer notifications and product recalls.
•    Appropriate microbiological batch release specifications (i.e., total counts, identification of bioburden to detect objectionable microbes) for each of your drug products.
•    A comprehensive, independent assessment of your laboratory practices, procedures, methods, equipment, documentation, and analyst competencies. Based on this review, provide a detailed plan to remediate and evaluate the effectiveness of your laboratory system.
•    An assessment of each drug product process to ensure that there is a data-driven and scientifically sound program that identifies and controls all sources of variability, such that your production processes, and will consistently meet appropriate specifications and manufacturing standards.
•    A detailed summary of your validation program for ensuring a state of control throughout the product lifecycle, along with associated procedures. Describe your program for process performance qualification, and ongoing monitoring of both intra-batch and inter-batch variation to ensure a continuing state of control.
•    A timeline for performing appropriate process performance qualification for each of your marketed drug products.
•    Your process performance protocol(s), and written procedures for qualification of equipment and facilities.
3.    Your firm failed to exercise appropriate controls over computer or related systems to   assure that only authorized personnel institute changes in master production and control records, or other records (21 CFR 211.68(b)).
Your(b)(4)Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy computerized system did not have appropriate controls in place to prevent deletion of raw laboratory data. Specifically, this data is used to create an internal certificate of analysis to release drug components for drug product manufacturing. Further, you did not have appropriate password protection of your software to prevent unauthorized access to data.
In your response, you stated that you have password-protected the software for the FTIR system and only the chemist has access to the data. You also stated that the FTIR data is backed up(b)(4)to an external hard drive and a copy is printed and included as part of the raw material test data package.
Your response is inadequate as it did not provide a retrospective review of the integrity of your FTIR, details regarding instrument audit trails and an evaluation of the effectiveness of the computerized system change. It is important to maintain strict controls over CGMP electronic data to ensure all additions, deletions, or modifications of information in your electronic records are authorized and properly documented. Without complete and accurate records, you cannot make appropriate decisions about batch release, stability, and other fundamental factors for ongoing quality assurance.
Your quality system does not adequately ensure the accuracy and integrity of data to support the safety, effectiveness, and quality of the drugs you manufacture. See FDA’s guidance document Data Integrity and Compliance With Drug CGMP for guidance on establishing and following CGMP compliant data integrity practices at https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/data-integrity-and-compliance-drug-cgmp-questions-and-answers-guidance-industry.
In response to this letter, provide the following:
•    Comprehensive investigation into the extent of the inaccuracies in data records and reporting, including results of the data review for drugs distributed to the United States. Include a detailed description of the scope and root causes of your data integrity lapses.
•    A current risk assessment of the potential effects of the observed failures on the quality of your drugs. Your assessment should include analyses of the risks to patients caused by the release of drugs affected by a lapse of data integrity and analyses of the risks posed by ongoing operations.
•    A management strategy for your firm that includes the details of your global CAPA plan. The detailed corrective action plan should describe how you intend to ensure the reliability and completeness of all data generated by your firm including microbiological and analytical data, manufacturing records, and all data submitted to FDA.
Unapproved New Drug Violations
(b)(4)and(b)(4)are drugs as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, these products are intended for use as skin bleaching products.
Examples of the claims observed on your product labels that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of your products include, but may not be limited to, the following:
•(b)(4)“Indicated for the depigmentation of dark areas of the skin such as age spots, liver spots, freckles, and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.”
•(b)(4)“Indicated for the depigmentation of dark areas of the skin such as age spots, liver spots, freckles, and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.”
•(b)(4)“[I]ndicated for the gradual lightening of hyperpigmented skin conditions, such as chloasma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines, and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.”
•(b)(4)“Indications: Skin lightener”
•(b)(4)“Indications Skin lightener”
•(b)(4)“Indications Skin lightener”
All skin bleaching drug products, whether currently labeled as prescription or nonprescription, are considered new drugs as defined in section 201(p)(1) of the FD&C Act.2New drugs may not be legally marketed in the United States absent FDA approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Because no FDA-approved applications are in effect these products, the current marketing of these products violate section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce violates section 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d).
Misbranding Violations
In addition,(b)(4)is misbranded under section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). This violation is described in more detail below.
(b)(4)is a “drug” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for the treatment of acne.
Examples of claims observed on the(b)(4)product label and/or labeling that provide evidence of the intended use (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Helps to unclog pores with deep cleaning action to prevent future breakouts . . . Drug Facts …. Purpose: Acne Treatment.”
(b)(4)is misbranded within the meaning of section 502(c) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(c), because the label fails to bear a statement of identity as required under 21 CFR 201.61. The label for this product fails to include the established name and general pharmacological category(ies) or principal intended action(s) of the product. For example, the principal display panel should bear “0.5% Salicylic Acid Acne Treatment.”
The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Registration and Listing Misbranding Violations
(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)),(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)), and(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)) are “drugs” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because they are intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, these products are intended for lightening of skin pigmentation.
Examples of claims observed on the(b)(4),(b)(4), and(b)(4)product label and labeling that provide evidence of the intended use (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the products include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“indicated for the gradual bleaching of hyperpigmented skin conditions such as chlosma, melasma, freckles, senile lentigines and other unwanted areas of melanin hyperpigmentation.”
Under section 510 of the FD&C Act, as amended, and 21 CFR Part 207, all drugs manufactured, prepared, propagated, compounded, or processed for U.S. commercial distribution must be listed with FDA (see 21 U.S.C. 360(j)(1) and 21 CFR 207.41). Current drug listing submissions for(b)(4)for “Balancer” (NDC(b)(4)) and “Skin Lightener (NDC(b)(4)) fail to include Sanitor Corporation as the manufacturing establishment for these products. In addition, these two drug listing submissions, and a third drug listing submission for(b)(4)(NDC(b)(4)) reference private label distributor’s drugs. Each registrant must list each drug it manufactures, repacks, or relabels for commercial distribution under the trade name or label of a private label distributor using an NDC that includes such private label distributor's labeler code (21 CFR 207.41(c)(1)) AND each registrant must list each human drug it manufactures, repacks, or relabels using an NDC that includes the registrant's own labeler code, regardless of whether the drug is commercially distributed under the registrant's own label or trade name or under the label or trade name of a private label distributor (21 CFR 207.41(c)(2)). Your firm’s failure to fulfill its drug listing obligations for(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)),(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)), and(b)(4)(Hydroquinone(b)(4)) misbrands these products under section 502(o) of the FD&C Act.
The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Ineffective Quality System
Your executive management oversight and control over the manufacture of drugs is inadequate. Your executive management remains responsible for fully resolving all deficiencies and ensuring ongoing CGMP compliance. You should immediately and comprehensively assess your company’s manufacturing operations to ensure that systems, processes, and the products manufactured conform to FDA requirements.
Responsibilities as a ContractorDrugs must be manufactured in conformance with CGMP. FDA is aware that many drug manufacturers use independent contractors such as production facilities, testing laboratories, packagers, and labelers. FDA regards contractors as extensions of the manufacturer.  You are responsible for the quality of drugs you produce as a contract facility regardless of agreements in place with product owners. You are required to ensure that drugs are made in accordance with section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act for safety, identity, strength, quality, and purity. See FDA’s guidance document Contract Manufacturing Arrangements for Drugs: Quality Agreements at https://www.fda.gov/media/86193/download.CGMP Consultant Recommended
We acknowledge the statement in your response dated June 24, 2021, that you have retained a consultant who is knowledgeable and experienced in CGMP compliance issues with pharmaceuticals, medical devices, cosmetics, and dietary supplements. However, based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant, as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34, with at minimum, appropriate CGMP expertise in overall quality risk management, data integrity, and investigations to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.
Conclusion
Correct any violations promptly. Failure to promptly and adequately address this matter may result in regulatory or legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction. Unresolved violations may also prevent other Federal agencies from awarding contracts.
Failure to address violations may also cause FDA to withhold issuance of Export Certificates. FDA may withhold approval of new applications or supplements listing your firm as a drug manufacturer until any violations are completely addressed and we confirm your compliance with CGMP. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed corrective actions to address any violations.
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.

1See, e.g., Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19). Because your benzalkonium chloride-based hand sanitizer is not consistent with the formulations in these guidances, it does not fall within any temporary Agency policy not to take action against firms manufacturing hand sanitizer products for violations of section 505 of the FD&C Act.
2Prior to September 23, 2020, certain drug products intended for skin bleaching, including products that contained 2% or less of hydroquinone, were subject to ongoing over-the-counter (OTC) drug rulemaking. However, beginning on September 23, 2020, all skin-bleaching products that were previously the subject of OTC drug rulemaking are deemed to be a new drug(s) as defined in section 201(p)(1) of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER
December 1, 2021
RE: 617713
Dear Mr. Santos:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.vitastik.com in September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for a variety of oral inhalation products under the “VitaStik” product line including, but not limited to: “VitaStik Breathe Essential Oil Stick - Spearmint Menthol Aromatherapy,” “VitaStik Nootropic Inhaler – Focus Vitamin Essential Oil Inhaler,” “VitaStik Calm - Vanilla Green Tea with Valerian Aromatherapy for Anxiety,” “VitaStik Sleepy Time Sweet Honey Lavender Melatonin Diffuser,” and “VitaStik Silver Bullet Menthol Arctic Blast - Asthma, Nasal, Allergy Relief” (hereinafter “VitaStik products”). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/vitastik, www.instagram.com/vitastik, and www.youtube.com. These social media websites direct consumers to your website www.vitastik.com to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Furthermore, the use of VitaStik products raises safety concerns for the agency because the ingredients and/or impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm or bronchospasm, may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways, or may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects or organ toxicity.
You appear to be marketing your products as supplements. For example, the product packaging for your “VitaStik Sleepy Time Diffuser” contains a Supplement Facts panel. Although you market your products as “edible formulas,” your products’ labeling states that they are intended for inhalation. For example, your product labeling instructs on the “INHALE METHOD: Short, Shallow Breath from White Air Hole Side. Hold, then Exhale via the nose for Maximum Aromatherapy Effect. Best to pause at least 1 minute between uses.” The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i), 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i), as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your VitaStik products are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your VitaStik products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act.
Based on our review of your website, your VitaStik products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your website www.vitastik.com and your social media websites at www.facebook.com/vitastik, www.instagram.com/vitastik, and www.youtube.com, that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

o “[T]he Breathe Formula in particular was created by the founder of VitaStik. Like millions of other people, our founder suffered from acute Asthma. . . For over two years he mixed various organics searching for a way to find breathing relief, without the addicting chemicals used in inhalers. After many, many, many failures, the Final Breathe Formula was born. . . so he gave the Breathe Formula to some friends who suffered from Asthma and Bronchitis. He asked them, next time you feel an attack coming on, try one quick inhalation of our Patent Pending Breathe Formula. Give it 30 seconds he said, and if you don't feel an instant relief, then resume to your standard drug relief treatment . . . All agreed . . .and we repeat the word ‘all’ agreed, that there was an instant bronchial relief provided after just 1 deep inhalation from the Breathe Stick.”o “I really like it, just wish it worked for my asthma a little quicker!”

Works to instantly open your breathing pathways. . . The Breathe Stick and Silver Bullet also work as a Nasal Decongestant.”
Your VitaStik products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective. No approved applications are in effect for your products.

Unapproved New Drugs
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.Your products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self- diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your Baicalin, Curcumin, DHM, and Milk Thistle Extract products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labeling is incomplete. Serving size must be expressed in common household measures as set forth in 21 CFR 101.9(b) followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parentheses.
We note, your Baicalin, Curcumin, DHM, and Milk Thistle Extract products’ labeling fails to declare a complete and accurate statement of the net quantity of contents. For example, the product label expresses the net weight in metric units but fails to express the weight in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce as required by 21 CFR 101.7(b)(1). For packages labeled in terms of weight, the net quantity of contents shall be expressed in pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(1).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

RE: 617979
Dear Mr. Matzkin:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.nutrovape.com and https://nutriair.com/ in October 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for numerous “vaporizer” products, including but not limited to the products named “nutrovape B-Complex,” “nutrovape Diet,” “nutrovape Energy,” “nutrovape Focus,” and “nutrovape Recover” (hereinafter referred to as your “nutrovape vaporizer products”) and “diffuser” products, including but not limited to products named “nutriair Energy,” “nutriair Focus,” “nutriair Immune,” “nutriair Relax,” “nutriair Recover,” and “nutriair Sleep” (hereinafter referred to as your “nutriair diffuser products”)1. We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/nutriair, www.facebook.com/trynutrovape, www.instagram.com/nutri.air, www.instagram.com/nutrovape, www.twitter.com/nutriair, www.twitter.com/nutrovape. These social media websites direct consumers to www.nutrovape.com or https://nutriair.com/, respectively, to purchase your products. The claims on your websites, social media websites, and product packaging, establish that your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Furthermore, the use of your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products raises safety concerns for the agency because the ingredients and/or impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm or bronchospasm, may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways, or may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects or organ toxicity.
You appear to be marketing your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products as dietary supplements. For example, the labeling for your “Relax” and “Sleep” products in your nutriair and nutrovape product lines include Supplement Facts panels. However, the products’ labeling also states that they are intended for inhalation. The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i), 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i), as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act.
Based on our review of your websites, social media websites, and product packaging, your nutrovape vaporizer products and nutriair diffuser products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/ or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Some examples of claims observed on your websites and social media websites that established the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

Dear Eagle Energy:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://eagle.energy in September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for “Caffeine Pen” products packaged as “Lychee Ice” and “Guarana Berry” (hereinafter referred to as your “Caffeine Pen” products). We have also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/MyEagleEnergy/. This social media website directs consumers to your website https://eagle.energy/ to purchase your products.

Therefore, your “Caffeine Pen” products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act.
Based on our review of your website, social media website, and product packaging, your Caffeine Pen products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your website https://eagle.energy, your social media website https://www.facebook.com/MyEagleEnergy/, and your product packaging that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On the website https://eagle.energy/:
“Our Caffeine Pen TECHNOLOGY
Backed by an unwavering commitment to research, quality and innovation, Eagle Energy utilizes a proprietary, plant-based formula—including guarana extract, ginseng extract, and vitamin B12—and a customized heating system engineered to deliver a natural, effective, and inhalable caffeine alternative.”
“Developed as a healthy caffeine alternative, Eagle Energy is the first and only energy supplement that boost energy with natural, plant-based ingredients, including guarana, ginseng and vitamin B12. Safe, effective and easy to use—welcome to the future of caffeine.”
“Unleash the natural
POWER OF GUARANAHarvested from the lush Amazon rainforests of Brazil, guarana is nature’s caffeine. The seeds from guarana fruit contain stimulants that boost energy while improving mental clarity, athletic performance and weight loss.”
“Ability to control the effects
Ingested caffeine stays in your system for over 5 hours, which can cause jitters and impact sleep. However, when inhaling caffeine, it metabolizes quite quickly and lasts about 1 hour. Which means with Eagle Energy, you can control the level and duration of your energy boost.”
“Is it safe to inhale caffeine?
Yes. Based on over a decade of third party research on micro-dosing botanicals and vaporizer technology, Eagle Energy uses a lower temperature threshold than typical vaporizers to avoid the creation of unintended byproducts, as well as plant-based stimulants which are known to be easy on the lungs and airways when absorbed, compared to synthetic stimulants. We also know that the natural caffeine stimulants in guarana absorb and metabolize quickly, lasting about 1 hour. The recommended serving size is 5 to 20 breaths, depending on your caffeine sensitivity. Unlike drinking caffeine, there are no side-effects like jitters, stomach-ache, and other gastro-issues.”
“How long does an Eagle Energy Booster last?
Each Eagle Energy Booster unit offers approximately 400 breaths, assuming 3 seconds per inhalation. Depending on your caffeine sensitivity, the serving size is 5 to 20 breaths.”
From your blog articles on the webpage: https://eagle.energy/blogs/news:
“[G]inseng is generally believed to restore and enhance wellbeing along with the following evidence-based health benefits:
Reduces inflammationA potent antioxidant, Ginseng has been shown to help reduce inflammatory markers and protect against stress.
Strengthens the immune systemGinseng can boost immune function and help prevent infections.Increases energyGinseng can help fight fatigue, promote energy, and enhance physical activity.
Sharpens brain functionGinseng has been shown to improve mental cognitive functions and increase feelings of calmness while being a natural mood booster.”
“Vitamin B12 is a nutrient that helps keep the body’s nerve and blood cells healthy and helps make DNA, the genetic material in all cells. Vitamin B12 also helps prevent a type of anemia called megaloblastic anemia that makes people tired and weak.
And as Healthline reports, in addition to cell formation and energy boosting qualities, Vitamin B12 has even more science-based health benefits including:
Supporting bone health and preventing osteoporosisEye health and reducing macular degenerationUplifting mood and symptoms of depressionImproving memory lossPromoting healthy hair, skin and nails”
“[L]ychee is known as the ‘Queen of Fruits’ due to its long history of health benefits, including boosting immunity, regulating blood pressure, and aiding weight loss.”

On your November 16, 2020 post: “10/10 would definitely get again! I love the lychee ice so much! I have really bad GERD and this surprisingly helped tremendously.”
On your November 23, 2020 post: “Fun Fact: Eagle Energy contains Vitamin B12 which not only reduces fatigue, but also regulates mood, supports memory and brain health.”
On your product packaging:
“GUARANA
The seeds from guarana fruit contain stimulants that boost energy while improving mental clarity, athletic performance and weight loss.”
VITAMIN B12An essential energy super supplement, Vitamin B12 helps keep the body’s nerve and blood cells healthy, reducing fatigue.
GINSENGGinseng is a potent antioxidant known to boost brain function. It can also strengthen the immune system, reduce inflammation, and increase energy.”
“1. How does Eagle Energy compare to the boost I get from an energy drink?
When you inhale Eagle Energy’s natural, plant-based caffeine, you will start to feel an energy boost in about 5 minutes. A sugar-filled energy drink takes over 30 minutes to take full effect. There is also no sugar or calories in Eagle Energy, which means no weight gain or sugar crash.
2. Will the caffeine in Eagle Energy give me the jitters?
Unlike drinking caffeine, which stays in your system for over 5 hours and can cause jitters, Eagle Energy metabolizes quite quickly and lasts about 1 hour. So, you can control the level and duration of your energy boost, avoiding the jitters.
3. Caffeine can give me a stomach ache—will Eagle Energy?
The natural caffeine in Eagle Energy comes from guarana berries, which when consumed in microdoses, does not irritate the stomach or cause other gastro-issues.”

RE: 613688
Dear Nancy Abbott:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at Internet address https://www.dominant-nutrition.com/ in September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products ADIPROPEN ULTRA, SUPERJOINTS, OPTIMUM-CLA, and LipogenX. Based on a review of your website, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Adulterated Dietary Supplement
Labeling on your website at https://www.dominant-nutrition.com/ establishes that you offer for sale your product LipogenX as a dietary supplement and that the product’s Supplement Facts panel declares Hordenine as a dietary ingredient in this product. Hordenine is a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)]. Further, as a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, Hordenine is a “new dietary ingredient” under section 413(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that Hordenine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. In the absence of such information, Hordenine is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Because the required notification has not been submitted, your product is adulterated under sections 402(f)(1)(B) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f)(1)(B) and 350b(a)].
Even if the required notification had been submitted, we know of no evidence that would establish that your product is not adulterated. In the absence of a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that Hordenine, when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of your product, will reasonably be expected to be safe, dietary supplements containing Hordenine as a new dietary ingredient are adulterated under sections 402(f)(1)(B) and 413(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f)(1)(B) and 350b(a)] because there is inadequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury. Introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) and (v) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)]. To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that Hordenine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient.
Unapproved New Drugs
The claims on your website establish that your products ADIPROPEN ULTRA, SUPERJOINTS, and OPTIMUM-CLA are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your product webpage for “ADIPROPEN ULTRA”:
“ADIPROPEN ULTRA is our new and improved version of Adipropen with added Vinpocetine, commonly referred to as ‘Viagra for the Brain.’ [I]t is more effective than Clenbuterol.”
On your product webpage for “SUPERJOINTS”:
“SUPERJOINTS contains an amazing healing extract called Cissus Quadrangularis that has the miraculous ability to relieve joint pain and heal joint damage. Used for centuries as medicine, Cissus Quadrandularis can speed joint fracture healing rates . . .. It also aids in healing tendons and ligaments in even the most stubborn cases.”
On your product webpage for “OPTIMUM-CLA”:
“Conjugated linoleum Acid (CLA): is a potent . . . anti-carcinogen, and anti-catabolic . . . Some of the common accolades of CLA are . . . is a cancer fighter.”
Your products ADIPROPEN ULTRA, SUPERJOINTS, and OPTIMUM-CLA are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product OPTIMUM-CLA is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purpose. Accordingly, OPTIMUM-CLA fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Office of Human and, Animal Food Operations West Division 3, Attention: Dana Lewis, 1201 Main St, Suite 7200, Dallas, Texas 75202 or by email to Dana.Lewis@fda.hhs.gov.

Dear Mr. Mills:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.organa.net and your social media website at www.facebook.com/organainternational in June 2021.

We have also reviewed your social media website, www.facebook.com/organainternational, which directs consumers to your webpage at www.organa.net to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] in that they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

In addition, your Facebook page contains evidence of intended use of your products as drugs, including evidence in the form of personal testimonials that you posted recommending or describing the use of your products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevent of disease. Examples of such evidence of intended use includes:
• On June 15, 2020, Organa posted the following: “Rhodium is now being heavily researched as a means to treat cancer…”• On February 25, 2020, Organa posted the following testimonial from “Annie”: “The Silver has worked wonderfully on cuts, burns, and bugbites [sic]. We all came down with flu symptoms but since we’re all taking silver, it’s Ben [sic] going way [sic] before it can really get started. I began drinking it as soon as I felt the tickle in my thrust [sic] and I’m almost completely better belie [sic] the week is out. I’ve bought two bottles and am ordering one today because it really works and there are no crazy side effects as opposed to pharmesutical [sic] antibiotics.”• On January 22, 2020, Organa posted the following testimonial from an “Organa Customer”: “I started taking Copper one week ago because of swelling in my legs and pain from a torn ligament. I was taking products for joint support but still had pain and swelling. I RESEARCHED and read that Copper pulls nutrients into ligamints [sic].

In one study, vision loss was reduced by 10 percent in people taking supplements…of zinc . . .. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that indicates that poor zinc intake is related to . . . cataract formation; and optic neuritis, the inflammation of the optic nerve. Zinc is still 15% off! Head to our website now and get yourself a bottle”• On December 10, 2019, Organa posted the following: “Many studies have shown that a zinc deficiency can impair a large variety of immune functions and defense mechanisms in animals, and some studies have shown similar effects in humans. These effects include abnormalities and eventual shrinking of the spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes; and impaired production of antibodies-have been found to be correctable with zinc supplementation. Zinc is on sale this month! Make sure you head over to our website to get some before the sale ends!”
Your Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Vanadium, MSM (Methylsulfonylmethane), Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here1, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355] is in effect for any of these products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d)].
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, MSM, Vanadium, Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis, prevention, or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Uplift, Immune Boost, Essiac Tea, Gold, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, MSM, Vanadium, Silver, Relieve Progesterone Cream, and Silver Gel products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].Dietary Supplement Misbranding Charges
Even if your Copper, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Zinc, Essiac Tea, Gold, Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Vanadium, and Silver were not unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded drugs and described above, they would be misbranded foods under section 403 of the Act, as follows:
1. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 403(s)(2)(B)] in that the labels fail to identify your products using the term “dietary supplement” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.3(g), which requires that a dietary supplement be identified by the term “dietary supplement” as part of the product’s statement of identity, except the word “dietary” may be deleted and replaced by the name of the dietary ingredient in the product or an appropriate descriptive term. The product labels include a Supplements Facts label, which is evidence of your intent to market the products as Dietary Supplements.
2. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size on the labels are incorrect. The terms “serving” or “serving size” for a dietary supplement are defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 101.12, Table 2, as the maximum amount recommended on the label for consumption per eating occasion. The labels state the serving size is “1 tsp” while the directions indicate to “Take 2 tsp. once or twice daily as needed.” Furthermore, your “Silver” product is also misbranded because its label fails to include a serving size. The product labels fail to follow the listed “serving size” common measure with the equivalent metric quantity as required by 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7).
3. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) [21 U.S.C. §343(q)(1)B] and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343(q)(5)(F)] because the labels fail to declare the number of servings per container under the serving size on the left hand side of the nutrition label or fails to include this information as part of the net quantity of contents declaration in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
4. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 § (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products fail to enclose the nutrition information (Supplement Facts label) in a box using hairlines and titled with bolded “Supplement Facts” (not “Supplemental Facts” as incorrectly noted on your product labels) set full width, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1) and (2). Furthermore, all nutrition information within the nutrition label (Supplement Facts label) must utilize all black or one color type, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(3)(ii)
b. The labels for your “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” and “Zinc” products list iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc, respectively in the nutrition information label. Iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, and zinc are (b)(2)-dietary ingredients (i.e., a dietary ingredient that has a Reference Daily Intake (RDI). Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
c. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver”, “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products fail to include the subheading “Servings Per Container” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(ii) and 101.36(e)(6)(i). A heavy bar must be placed beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” except that if “Servings Per Container” is not required and, as a result, not declared, the bar must be placed beneath the subheading “Serving Size”.
d. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” “Silver”, and “Essiac Tea” products fail to include a heavy bar beneath the last (b)(3)-dietary ingredient (other dietary ingredient), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(iii).
e. The following product labels are misbranded in that they fail to list “Other ingredients” in a separate “Other ingredients” list outside and immediately below the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g):i. The product labels for Copper and Gold list “Purified Water” within the Supplement Facts label
ii. The product labels for Indium, Iron, Magnesium, Manganese, Molybdenum, Palladium, Rhodium, Ruthenium, Vanadium, and Zinc list “Distilled Water” within the Supplement Facts
iii. The product label for Essiac Tea lists the “Other Ingredients: Distilled Water, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benzoate, and Phosphoric Acid” within the Supplement Facts label.
f. The labels for your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Vanadium,” “Silver,” and “Zinc” bear the following or similar statement: “Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000-calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
g. Several of your product labels are for persons within more than one group. If a product is for persons within more than one group, the percent of Daily Value for each group must be presented in separate columns, as required in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).
h. The Essiac Tea product label lacks a declaration of % Daily Value. Furthermore, on several of your product labels the statement *“Percentage Daily Value not established” is not linked to a symbol elsewhere in the nutrition information label, as required by 21 101.36 (b)(3)(iv).
i. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc,” are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to accurately declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7 and 15 U.S.C.§ 1453(a)(2) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.
j. Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” and “Zinc,” are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that each label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
k. Your Essiac Tea product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product label bears a nutrient content claim, but the product does not meet the requirements to make such claim. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(l)(A) of the Act. Specifically, your Essiac Tea product label bears the claim, “Slippery Elm [an ingredient in your Essiac Tea product]: Rich in . . . antioxidants,” but use of this “antioxidant” nutrient content claim fails to comply with the requirements listed in 21 CFR 101.54(g). These requirements state, in part, that for a product to bear such a claim, a reference daily intake (RDI) must have been established for each of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim [21 CFR 101.54(g)(l)], and these nutrients must have recognized antioxidant activity [21 CPR 101.54(g)(2)]. The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must also be sufficient to qualify for the claim under 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e), as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(3). Further, nutrient content claims using the term ""antioxidant"" must include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim as part of the claim or, alternatively, the term ""antioxidant"" or ""antioxidants"" may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of the product label, followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity [21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)]. Your claim ""[r]ich in antioxidants"" is a nutrient content claim, but Essiac Tea does not meet the requirements to bear such a claim because the claim does not include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim or state them on the same panel and link them with an asterisk, as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g).
l. The Essiac product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the product label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure, and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
• Your “Copper,” “Gold,” “Indium,” “Iron,” “Magnesium,” “Manganese,” “Molybdenum,” “Palladium,” “Rhodium,” “Ruthenium,” “Silver,” “Vanadium,” “Zinc,” and “Essiac Tea” products contain the statement, “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease. Statements have not been evaluated by the FDA.” This disclaimer is not in accordance with the required text. Per 101.93, the required text should state: “These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” Furthermore, this disclaimer is not linked to any specific structure function claim on the product label. The FDA disclaimer statement as noted on your product label must be bolded and set off in a box, and the symbol preceding the disclaimer statement must be linked to the same symbol placed at the end of each structure function statement on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(d) and (e).
• For your product labels, there is no provision in the regulations for the listing of “Ingredients” as a heading in the Supplement Facts label.
• Your Essiac Tea product label lists the chemical preservatives sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate and phosphoric acid but does not bear labeling stating that fact, in that the label fails to include a separate description of their function as a preservative in accordance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).
• The directions for use statements on your product labels are placed before the nutrition information. Directions for use are considered intervening material. All information appearing on the information panel must appear in one place without other intervening material, as required by 21 CFR 101.2(e).
• The Essiac Tea product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, “Turkish rhubarb” is not a standardized common name of a botanical dietary ingredient listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Hanna L. Potter, Compliance Officer; 6th Ave and Kipling St, DFC Bldg. 20, PO Box 25087, Denver, Colorado, 80225-0087 or via email at hanna.potter@fda.hhs.gov.

October 14, 2021
RE: 615846
Dear Xiang Lu Peng:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your website at www.newgreenusa.com in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for “Xiao Ke Wan” (aka “XiaoKe Pills”), “Diabetee-Care,” and “Specific Jiang Tang Remedy.” We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/NewGreenNutrition and https://twitter.com/newgreenusa; these social media websites direct consumers to your website www.newgreenusa.com to purchase products. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your “Xiao Ke Wan,” “Diabetee-Care,” and “Specific Jiang Tang Remedy” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Some examples of claims observed on your websites and in your product labels that establish the intended uses of your above products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Xiao Ke Wan• Product description from your website www.newgreenusa.com/products/xiao-ke-wan: “The classic herbal formula helps maintain blood glucose level.”• From a July 4, 2021 post on your Facebook account at www.facebook.com/NewGreenNutrition: “These [sic] really help . . . to regulate blood sugars by strengthening the pancreas.”• From a July 4, 2021 post on your Twitter account at https://twitter.com/newgreenusa: “Helps maintain blood glucose level”• From your product package insert: “Indicated for . . . type II diabetes . . ..”
Diabetee-Care• The name of the product from your website www.newgreenusa.com/: “Diabetee-Care”
Specific Jiang Tang Remedy• Product description from your website www.newgreenusa.com: “A dietary supplement that helps . . . reducing the content of the blood sugar and urine sugar.”
Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Xiao Ke Wan,” “Diabetee-Care,” and “Specific Jiang Tang Remedy” products are also “new drugs” as defined by section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because they are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a). No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act are in effect for these products. Accordingly, their introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce violates sections 301(d), 21 U.S.C. 331(d), and 505(a) of the FD&C Act.
Misbranded Drugs
Your “Xiao Ke Wan,” “Diabetee-Care” and “Specific Jiang Tang Remedy” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use the products safely for their intended uses. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirement that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Furthermore, prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1), include those that, because of their toxicity or other potentiality for harmful effect, and/or the collateral measures necessary for their use, are not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer them. Your “Xiao Ke Wan” product label lists the ingredient glibenclamide (also known as glyburide), a blood glucose lowering agent in a class of drugs called sulfonylurea. By offering a drug containing glyburide, an active pharmaceutical ingredient in multiple FDA-approved drug products, without requiring a prescription, you are jeopardizing patient safety and misbranding the drug under section 503(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1). Dispensing a prescription drug without a prescription is an act which results in the drug being misbranded while held for sale, in violation of section 301(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(k).
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

Warning Letter320-22-02
October 8, 2021
Dear Ms. Lee:
Your firm was registered as a human drug manufacturer. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted testing of a consumer antiseptic rub drug product (also referred to as a consumer hand sanitizer), labeled as Hand Sanitizer Original. This drug product was labeled as manufactured at your facility, AriBio H&B Co., Ltd., FEI 3009836687, at 77, Hanbangexpo-ro5-gil, Jecheon-si, Chungcheongbukdo. Following an attempt to import Hand Sanitizer Original into the United States, it was detained and refused admission at the border.
The results of the FDA laboratory testing of a batch of this product detained at the border demonstrate that this drug product labeled as manufactured at your facility is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(c) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act or Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(c), in that its strength, purity, or quality falls below that which it purports or is represented to possess. In addition, this product is adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)), in that the subpotency, in addition to the deficiencies in your response to the information we requested during the November 20, 2020 teleconference, demonstrates that the quality assurance within your facility is not functioning in accordance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements.
In addition, Hand Sanitizer Original drug product is misbranded under sections 502(a) and (x) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a) and (x). Introduction or delivery for introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.
Adulteration Violations
Hand Sanitizer Original, labeled as manufactured at your facility, is labeled to contain 70% weight by volume (w/v) of the active ingredient anhydrous ethanol (ethanol). However, FDA laboratory testing of a batch of this product detained at the border found that the drug product contained an average of only 58% w/v ethanol. This hand sanitizer drug product is adulterated under section 501(c) of the FD&C Act in that the active ingredient of ethanol is present at levels in the products lower than that which is declared on their labeling.CDC recommends1that, if soap and water are not readily available, consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains not less than 60% alcohol (ethanol). This is the minimum active ingredient concentration of ethanol specified in the 1994 Tentative Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products (59 FR 31402 (June 17, 1994)), as further amended by “Safety and Effectiveness of Consumer Antiseptics; Topical Antimicrobial Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use; Proposed Amendment of the Tentative Final Monograph; Reopening of Administrative Record,” Proposed Rule, 81 FR 42912 (June 30, 2016).
On November 20, 2020, FDA held a teleconference with you. We requested additional information concerning your CGMP operations, including test methods for your finished drug product, active ingredient supplier information, a statement confirming that you follow drug CGMP per 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211, and your investigation into the subpotent batch tested by FDA. In your responses, you provided details on the test method for release of finished hand sanitizer products but did not provide any documentation of what methanol content test method you or your suppliers are using or a scientific rationale for your ethanol content test method. Without adequate testing of incoming raw materials, as is required under 21 CFR 211.84, you cannot assure that your drug products conform to appropriate standards of identity, strength, quality and purity.
In response to this letter, provide the following:• A detailed follow-up investigation into how the hand sanitizer drug product described above, which was labeled as containing 70% ethanol, in fact contained an average of 58% ethanol.• A list of all raw materials used to manufacture your hand sanitizer drug products, including the suppliers’ names, addresses, and contact information.• A list of all batches of any hand sanitizer drug products shipped to the United States by your firm, and a full reconciliation of all material you distributed.• Copies of the complete batch records for all batches distributed to the United States.• Methanol content test method for your hand sanitizer drug products shipped to the United States.
The subpotency of hand sanitizer drug products labeled as manufactured in your facility, in addition to the deficiencies in your response to the information we requested during the November 20, 2020 teleconference, demonstrates that the quality assurance within your facility is not functioning in accordance with CGMP requirements under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act.2
Misbranding Violations
Hand Sanitizer Original is a “drug” as defined by section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a consumer topical antiseptic.
Examples of claims observed on the Hand Sanitizer Original product label that provide evidence of the intended use (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Hand Sanitizer Original. . . DRUG FACTS . . . Purpose: Antiseptic . . . Uses: Hand sanitizer to decrease bacteria on the skin that could cause disease . . . rub into the skin until dry.”
Hand Sanitizer Original is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), because its label contains statements that are false or misleading. The label includes the claims, “REDLAB Korea NO1 Dietary Supplement” and “H&B aribio Korea NO1 Dietary Supplement,” which imply that this product is a dietary supplement. However, the Uses and Directions sections of the Hand Sanitizer Original label indicate that the product is intended for use as a topical antiseptic, not for ingestion. Because the definition of dietary supplement specifies that a dietary supplement “is intended for ingestion” (section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)), Hand Sanitizer Original is not a dietary supplement. Declaring Hand Sanitizer Original to be a dietary supplement is therefore false or misleading.
This product is also misbranded under section 502(x) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(x), because the product label fails to disclose a domestic address or domestic telephone number through which the responsible person may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such drug.
The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
CGMP Consultant Recommended
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to evaluate your operations and to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements if your firm intends to resume manufacturing drugs for the U.S. market. We also recommend that the qualified consultant perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and that the consultant evaluates the completion and efficacy of your corrective actions and preventive actions before you pursue resolution of your firm’s compliance status with FDA. Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations associated with your drug products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.
Note that FDA placed all drugs and drug products manufactured by your firm on Import Alert 66-78 on March 4, 2021, as the methods used in and controls used for the manufacture, processing, packing, or holding of these products do not appear to conform to current good manufacturing practices within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act. Drugs and drug products that appear to be adulterated or misbranded may be detained or refused admission without physical examination.
All drugs and drug products manufactured by your firm may remain listed on this import alert until there is evidence establishing that the conditions that gave rise to the appearance of a violation have been resolved, and the Agency has confidence that future entries will be in compliance with the FD&C Act. This may include an inspection prior to the Agency considering the appearance of adulteration to be addressed.
If you decide you want to manufacture drugs for the United States in the future, request a Regulatory Meeting to discuss corrective actions.
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices. If you cannot do so within 15 working days, state your reasons for delay and your schedule for completion.

2Due to an increased demand for alcohol-based hand sanitizers during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA published the Guidance for Industry:Temporary Policy for Preparation of Certain Alcohol-Based Hand Sanitizer Products During the Public Health Emergency (COVID-19)on March 19, 2020, and subsequently updated the guidance several times, most recently on February 10, 2021. This guidance communicates the Agency’s temporary policy that we do not intend to take action against firms for CGMP violations under section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act if such firms prepare alcohol-based hand sanitizers for consumer use (or for use as a health care personnel hand rub) during the public health emergency, provided certain circumstances described in the guidance are present. These circumstances include preparation of hand sanitizer products using only the ingredients and formulas set forth in the guidance. In addition to the violative testing results detailed above that demonstrate the subpotency of a hand sanitizer product labeled as manufactured at your facility, a review of the purported formulation on the drug product’s labeling further indicates that this product is not prepared consistent with FDA’s temporary policy set forth in the guidance. Therefore, this product does not fall within the Agency’s temporary policy not to take action against firms manufacturing hand sanitizer products for violations of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: 21-HFD-45-09-02
Dear Mr. Hoang:
This Warning Letter informs you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted from March 15 to 23, 2021. Investigator Stuart W. Russell, representing FDA, reviewed the role of RAAS Nutritionals, LLC (RAAS) as the sponsor of the following clinical investigations:
(b)(4)1, 2, 3, 4, 5
(b)(4)
(b)(4)6
This inspection was conducted as a part of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to evaluate the conduct of research and to help ensure that the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects have been protected.
At the conclusion of the inspection, Investigator Russell presented and discussed with you and your staff the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge our receipt of RAAS’s April 7, 2021, written response to the Form FDA 483.
From our review of the FDA Establishment Inspection Report, the documents submitted with that report, and RAAS’s April 7, 2021, written response to the Form FDA 483, we conclude that RAAS did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and applicable regulations contained in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 312 [21 CFR 312] governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects. We wish to emphasize the following:
Failure to submit INDs for the conduct of clinical investigations with investigational new drugs that are subject to 21 CFR 312.2(a) [21 CFR 312.20(a), 312.20(b), and 312.40(a)].
FDA regulations require a sponsor to submit, and to have in effect, an investigational new drug application (IND) before initiating a clinical investigation of a drug subject to 21 CFR 312.2(a) in human subjects, unless the clinical investigation qualifies for an IND exemption under 21 CFR 312.2 (see 21 CFR 312.20 and 312.40(a)). RAAS failed to comply with these requirements. Specifically, RAAS initiated and conducted the following clinical investigations of investigational drug products subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act without submitting and having in effect an IND7:
The clinical investigation of the investigational drugs(b)(4)and(b)(4)conducted as part of the(b)(4)described above
The clinical investigation of the investigational drug(b)(4)conducted as part of the(b)(4)study described above
The clinical investigation of the investigational drug(b)(4)conducted as part of the(b)(4)study described above
In RAAS’s April 7, 2021, written response to the Form FDA 483, RAAS argued that it was not obligated to submit an IND before initiating these clinical investigations because the articles under study are dietary supplements and not drugs.
To support this argument, RAAS described previous written communications it had sent to the National Institutes of Health (NIH); the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority under the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; and the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs Stephen Hahn, M.D., regarding the use of its “non-pharmaceutical products”(b)(4). In addition, RAAS also described written communications with the(b)(4).
RAAS stated that it proceeded without an IND because it believed that if it was legally able to sell its nutritional supplements to the general public, it should be able to test and observe the effects of those supplements without an IND. RAAS believed that as long as it did not advertise in direct conjunction with a product sold in the market, the products could continue their designation as dietary supplements.
RAAS also asserted that it took steps to operate within FDA’s rules and to seek required authorization. RAAS stated that it delayed large-scale public introduction of the products pending FDA approval and did not advertise its products for use as drugs. In addition, RAAS stated that it was never its intention to sell or investigate the products as drugs. RAAS claimed that it received a communication from FDA stating that one of its compounds did not qualify as a drug, and that explicitly indicated that the sponsor did not need to proceed with an IND. In further arguing that the investigational products should be classified as dietary supplements, RAAS stated that its products are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) and are not new drugs, and that it had completed all legal steps to sell these products as dietary supplements. RAAS argued that it conducted a “medical observation in order to ascertain the extent of the beneficial properties of the supplements in order to apply for health claims or for qualified health claims.”
For the reasons described below, we conclude that the evidence collected on inspection shows that(b)(4)were intended for use as drugs, not as dietary supplements, in the three clinical investigations named above.
Section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] definesdrug, in part, as “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man or other animals . . . .” RAAS studied the efficacy and safety of the investigational products ((b)(4)) to cure, mitigate, and/or treat disease as described below:
As shown by a draft manuscript intended for publication, the objective of the COVID-19 Study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of(b)(4)and(b)(4)to cure, mitigate, and(b)(4)effect on symptom improvement,(b)(4)on(b)(4).
As shown by the protocol, the objective of the(b)(4)Study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of(b)(4)effect on the(b)(4).
As shown by the protocol, the objective of the(b)(4)Study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of(b)(4)to cure, mitigate, and treat(b)(4)effect on the(b)(4).
In fact, in its response to the Form FDA 483, RAAS stated that “our hopes were that the botanicals could have drug-like impact on the participant’s health (i.e., curing or preventing disease)[.]”
Whether an investigational article is a drug or a dietary supplement depends on the intent of the investigation. Based on the designs of the(b)(4)studies, the investigational products as used in these clinical investigations were drugs as defined in section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, because, respectively,(b)(4)and(b)(4)were studied to cure, mitigate, and treat(b)(4); because(b)(4)was studied to cure, mitigate, and treat(b)(4); and because(b)(4)was studied to cure, mitigate, and treat(b)(4).
Thus, before initiating the clinical investigations of(b)(4)and(b)(4)conducted under the studies referred to above as the(b)(4)study, the(b)(4)study, and the(b)(4)study, RAAS was required to submit INDs to FDA and to have these INDs in effect under 21 CFR 312.40. FDA records indicate that RAAS failed to submit INDs before conducting these clinical investigations. From the records collected on inspection, it appears that(b)(4)human subjects were enrolled at one clinical site for the(b)(4)study,(b)(4)human subjects completed the(b)(4)study, and(b)(4)human subjects completed the(b)(4)study.
RAAS’s claims that the FDA explicitly indicated that the sponsor did not need to proceed with an IND are unfounded. First, the referenced communication attributed to FDA was, in fact, from a representative of the NIH, a different government agency. Second, in this referenced communication, the NIH representative did not suggest that RAAS’s product was not considered a drug for purposes of the FD&C Act, or that an IND was not required. Rather, they merely stated that the product could not be tested for antiviral activity because it was an extract and not a pure compound – a determination very different from an opinion on whether the product at issue was a drug for purposes of the FD&C Act. We also note that RAAS’s communications with the(b)(4)regarding the legality of studies to be conducted there are immaterial to the question of the legal status of clinical investigations conducted in the United States.
Similarly, the purported GRAS status of RAAS’s products and the methods of its marketing of those products are very different from a determination on whether RAAS could conduct these studies without having an IND in effect. As discussed above,(b)(4)were considered drugs for the purposes of these studies. The purported GRAS status of an article for one or more uses in a dietary supplement does not exempt that same article from IND requirements when it is being investigated for use as a drug. In other words, an article may be a drug as used in a clinical trial even if it is considered a food or a dietary supplement as used in other contexts.
RAAS assured in its response that it “will use its best efforts to comply with the recommended use of IND . . . guidelines in the future based on our enhanced understanding of the rules provided by [FDA’s Office of Regulatory Affairs]”; however, RAAS also indicated that they would like to maintain their products’ designation as dietary supplements and will follow whatever advice or ruling the FDA offers to maintain this designation.
RAAS’s response is inadequate because it did not provide a corrective action plan explaining how it would comply with IND regulations. Without this information, we are unable to determine whether RAAS’s stated intent to comply with IND regulations is adequate to prevent similar violations in the future.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deficiencies with your clinical studies of investigational drugs. It is your responsibility to ensure adherence to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. You should address any deficiencies and establish procedures to ensure that any ongoing or future studies comply with FDA regulations.
Within 15 business days of your receipt of this letter, you should notify this office in writing of the actions you have taken to prevent similar violations in the future. Failure to adequately address this matter may lead to regulatory action. If you believe you have complied with the FD&C Act and relevant FDA regulations, please include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: CMS #614383
Dear Dr. Wilson:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org in July 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar, Dr. Wilson’s Super Immune Space Sprinkles, Dr. Wilson’s Cortisol Stress Reset, Dr. Wilson’s BFF, and Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim. The claims on your websites, www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org establish these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C.§ 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar product pages on www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adre nalfatigue.org:
“Refined carbohydrate consumption spikes your blood sugar up and the vicious cycle of blood sugar imbalance and insulin resistance continues…”
“Can people with diabetes or metabolic syndrome take Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar? . . . Diabetics and people with metabolic syndrome may find that Good Sugar . . . helps them feel their best.”
Additionally, your www.icahealth.com website includes the following on the Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar product page:
“Hypoglycemic properties of: [ingredients in Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar] cinnamon, gymnema, Indian Kino, fenugreek, jambolan, gulvel, chromium, magnesium, zinc, vanadium”
Dr. Wilson’s Super Immune Space Sprinkles product pages on www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“[Ingredients of Dr. Wilson’s Super Immune Space Sprinkles are] selected to support immune function in young intestinal tracts . . . Chronic or frequent stress can cause an increased tendency towards inflammation and decreased effectiveness of the deeper, adaptive aspects of immunity that defend against disease. This can leave your child more susceptible to colds, flu and other infections, as well as to the development of allergies.”
Dr. Wilson’s Cortisol Stress Reset product pages on www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Cortisol calming support for stressed-out people . . . The same cortisol-regulated changes designed to help you deal with an acute stressor become harmful when stress is frequent or chronic over extended periods of time. Chronically elevated:
o Blood sugar produces increased insulin, insulin resistance and increased abdominal fat, which can potentially develop into metabolic syndrome and diabeteso Blood pressure and heart rate contribute to cardiovascular diseaseo Excitatory brain stimulation can lead to anxiety and mood disorders, cognitive and memory impairment, sleep problems …o Stress hormones suppress immune function and makes cells less responsive to the anti-inflammatory actions of cortisol, increasing inflammation.”
Dr. Wilson’s BFF product pages on www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“[Dr. Wilson’s BFF] Supports general and specific aspects of immune function . . . . Stress & Immune Efficacy . . . With chronic stress, this cortisol-related decrease in immune efficacy can leave you more prone to recurrent outbreaks; more susceptible to colds, flu and other infections; and potentially more vulnerable to serious illness and degenerative disease down the road, as well as to the development of allergies and autoimmune disorders.”
“When stress is chronic or prolonged, both the increase in inflammation and the decrease in overall immune function can begin to adversely affect your health.”
Additionally, your www.adrenalfatigue.org website for the Dr. Wilson’s BFF product page includes:
“What does Dr. Wilson’s BFF do? Dr. Wilson’s BFF is designed to promote immune efficacy in preserving the outbreak-free (dormancy) phase of chronic infection”
Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim product pages on www.icahealth.com, www.drwilsons.com, and www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“[Ingredient(s) in Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim are] essential for immune function . . . . Stress and Immune Function . . . With chronic stress, this cortisol-related decrease in immune function can leave you more susceptible to colds, flu and other infections, and potentially make you more vulnerable to serious illness and degenerative disease down the road, as well as to the development of allergies and autoimmune disorders.”
“When stress is chronic or prolonged, both the increase in inflammation and the decrease in overall immune function can begin to adversely affect your health.”
In addition to claims on specific product pages, your websites also provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs because you describe the products as treating stress or adrenal fatigue and on separate pages describe specific diseases as being linked to stress or adrenal fatigue, thereby implying that your products are intended to cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease. Examples of this additional evidence of intended use include:
Webpage titled “About ICA Health” on www.icahealth.com:
“Each of our supplements is formulated by James L. Wilson, DC, ND, PhD to target specific health issues related to stress, including adrenal fatigue.”
The home page of www.drwilsons.com:
“Got Stress? We’ve Got the Solution! Dr. Wilson’s Original Formulations brand is a line of dietary supplements for stress formulated by Dr. James L. Wilson.”
Webpage titled “About Dr. James L. Wilson, DC, ND, PhD” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Read an article by Dr. Wilson describing why he formulated the Doctor Wilson’s Original Formulations® supplements for stress and adrenal fatigue”
Webpage titled “Why Dr. Wilson Created Supplements for Adrenal Fatigue” by Dr. James L. Wilson on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“I continue to pursue this mission through . . . developing equally unique and effective formulas targeted to areas of health adversely affected by stress, such as blood sugar balance and immune function.”
Webpage Article titled “How Stress Affects the Body” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“How Stress Affects the Body”
o “depression…”o “higher cholesterol, high blood pressure, increased risk of heart attack and stroke”o “increased inflammation … pains…”o “decreased immune function … increased risk of becoming ill…”Webpage Article titled “Stress and Health” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Stress and Immune Function . . . . With chronic stress, this cortisol-related decrease in immune function can leave you more susceptible to colds, flu and other infections, and potentially make you more vulnerable to serious illness and degenerative disease … as well as to the development of allergies and autoimmune disorders.”
“Stress and Thyroid Function . . . . When adrenal function is low, thyroid medication may be ineffective until adequate adrenal function (and cortisol) is restored. . . . This stress induced reduction in T3 and increase in reverse T3 in your cells results in tissue hypothyroidism that is not detected in standard thyroid function lab tests but can potentially produce . . . depression”
“Stress is also one of the environmental factors that increase vulnerability to thyroid autoimmunity (e.g. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis).”
Webpage Article titled “What Is Adrenal Fatigue?” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“What is Adrenal Fatigue? . . . Most commonly associated with intense or prolonged stress, it can also arise during or after acute or chronic infections, especially respiratory infections such as influenza, bronchitis or pneumonia.”
Webpage Article titled “Adrenal Function” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Adrenal Function in Blood Sugar Balance and Sugar Metabolism . . . . [C]hronic or repeated stress can contribute to persistent insulin resistance, and the resulting high levels of glucose (hyperglycemia) and insulin circulating in the blood that are likely precursors to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.”
“[A]drenal fatigue with concomitant hypoglycemia may create conditions and induce behaviors that can lead to a greater tendency to develop adult onset diabetes.”
“[S]ome level of adrenal fatigue often accompanies hypoglycemia, diabetes and metabolic syndrome.”
Webpage Article titled “Cortisol & Adrenal Function” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Chronically lower levels of circulating cortisol (as in adrenal fatigue) have been associated with negative effects, such as: … mild depression … low thyroid function … hypoglycemia … low blood pressure … Lowered immune function … Inflammation”
Webpage Article titled “FAQ on Adrenal Fatigue” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Is adrenal fatigue common in someone with cancer who is going through chemotherapy? The extreme fatigue that accompanies cancer and any other chronic illnesses is often the result of decreased adrenal function. Chronic illness and toxic treatments like chemotherapy are major stressors that the adrenals must respond to. . . . It is very important to provide adrenal support during this time.”
This webpage, as well as from a tab on the main website, link to an article titled “Adrenal Fatigue in Health Related Conditions” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Processes that take place in any chronic disease, from arthritis to cancer, place demands on your adrenal glands. Therefore, it is likely that if you are suffering from a chronic disease . . . your adrenals may have become fatigued to some degree.”
“Alcoholism and Addiction”
o “A common, but often ignored, component of alcoholism and some other addictions is fatigued adrenal glands. Adrenal fatigue and its associated hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) may often precede substance abuse”o “Adrenal support can greatly enhance the treatment protocol for alcoholism and many other types of addiction.”
“Autoimmune Disease”
o “During adrenal fatigue, it is less likely that your adrenal glands can produce enough cortisol to adequately counter these autoimmune inflammatory reactions.”
“Immunity”
o “[C]hronic, recurring or severe illness – particularly bronchitis, pneumonia or other respiratory infections – can contribute to fatiguing the adrenals”
“Dental Health”
o “Unresolved dental problems are common, but often unrecognized, sources of stress and adrenal fatigue. These include tooth abscesses . . . decayed teeth, root canals with sub-acute infections, gingivitis and other gum infections”
“Fibromyalgia”
o “The cause of fibromyalgia is unknown, but there seems to [be] general agreement that stress is a significant precipitating factor in its development. It has been commonly referred to as a “stress-related disorder” because stress both precedes its onset and aggravates it symptoms. . . . people with fibromyalgia are likely to also be experiencing some degree of adrenal fatigue.”o “Providing adequate support for healthy adrenal function during stress can be an important contributing factor in maintaining the vitality to avoid the stress-induced precipitation of fibromyalgia, and in facilitating full recovery from fibromyalgia.”
“Herpes”
o “Research has shown that herpes outbreaks increase in frequency with stresses . . . especially when adrenal function is low (as it is during adrenal fatigue).”o “[P]eople experiencing adrenal fatigue are likely to suffer more herpes outbreaks.”o “[A]s a chronic infection, herpes is a continuing body burden that can contribute to adrenal fatigue.”o “Adequate adrenal support . . . can be important factors in minimizing stressrelated herpes outbreaks.”
“Hypoglycemia”
o “Both stress and adrenal fatigue can contribute to hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) . . . . It has been known for almost a century that people who are chronically hypoglycemic are often also experiencing adrenal fatigue”
“Mild Depression”
o “[P]eople going through adrenal fatigue . . . have been observed clinically to often also experience mild depression.”
“Rheumatoid Arthritis”
o “RA [rheumatoid arthritis] … may contribute to adrenal fatigue.”o “[A]rthritic pain may seem more intense during adrenal fatigue.”o “Full adrenal support can be a crucial aid to health for people with RA.”
Webpage Article titled “The Uses and Wonders of L-Lysine” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Whether you’re suffering from high blood pressure, stress-induced anxiety … L-Lysine [an ingredient in Dr. Wilson’s BFF] may just be exactly was you’re looking for.”
“Some researchers believe this [L-Lysine’s] ability to save off outbreaks also helps in the prevention of many other diseases related to cranial nerves such as migraines, Meniere’s disease, and Bell’s palsy.”
“L-Lysine has also [been] shown to prevent high blood pressure”
Webpage Article titled “Stress and the Common Cold” on www.adrenalfatigue.org:
“Ways to support your immune system while under stress . . . Zinc [an ingredient in Dr. Wilson’s Immune Space Sprinkles, Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim, and Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar] is crucial in both innate (non-specific) and adaptive (antigen specific) immune function and is important in antibody formation. Deficiencies [in Zinc] . . . can severely weaken immune function.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar, Dr. Wilson’s Cortisol Stress Reset, Dr. Wilson’s BFF, and Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Dr. Wilson’s Good Sugar, Dr. Wilson’s Cortisol Stress Reset, Dr. Wilson’s BFF, and Dr. Wilson’s Nat-Stim fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

Dear Mr. Miletti:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://condemnedlabz.com/ and your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/condemnedl abzofficial/ in June, July and September 2021. Based on our review, FDA identified significant violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at https://condemnedlabz.com/ in June, July and September 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch. We also reviewed your social media website https://www.facebook.com/condemnedlabzofficial/, which directs consumers to your website https://condemnedlabz.com/ to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your website https://condemnedlabz.com/:On the product webpage for DNA Dispatch:• “Increases tolerance to pain”
On the product webpage for Humaslin:• “Reduces blood sugar levels”• “Optimizes insulin sensitivity”
In the blog “Nutrition” post titled, “Maximizing Insulin Sensitivity For Superior Muscle Growth,” dated September 6, 2021, which discusses your Humaslin:• At the top of the blog post, you display an image of a needle inserted into a glass vial.• “Having insulin resistance is a tell-tale sign that you’re experiencing difficulty metabolising glucose, and is often a warning sign of future health complications including high blood pressure, heart disease, heart failure, obesity, type 2 diabetes and even cancer. . . . The good news, is that just because you may have poor insulin sensitivity right now, you’re not doomed to be that way forever. . . . And, if you need some extra help getting insulin under control, Condemned Labz has created the ultimate glucose disposal agent / insulin mimetic in HumaSlin!”• “Make insulin work for you with Humaslin!”
In the blog “Supplements” post titled, “Pre Workout Stimulants 101,” dated August 25, 2021, regarding your Arsyn and ConvictStim:• “[H]igenamine [an ingredient in your ConvictStim] also acts as a bronchodilator…”• “Originally developed as a nasal decongestant for the treatment of bronchitis, 2-aminoisoheptane has emerged as a powerhouse pre workout simulant …” [your blog post discusses 2-aminoisoheptane in the context of your Arsyn and ConvictStim, which are labeled to contain 2-aminoisoheptane HCl]
On the product webpage for Thyrogenic, which describes the product as a “powerful thyroid complex”:• “An underactive thyroid can bring about a host of complications including depression… What’s more, an estimated 20 million Americans have some form of thyroid disorder, with as many as 60% of those affected are unaware of their condition.”
On your social media site https://www.facebook.com/condemnedlabzofficial/:
References to Humaslin:• A post dated November 25, 2016 –o “FORMULATED BY A Type 1 DIABETIC NATIONAL LEVEL COMPETITOR WHOS [sic] KNOWN FOR CONDITIONING… HumaSlin is Condemned Labz advanced Insulin…manipulating formula.”o “TESTIMONIAL FROM . . . NATIONAL LEVEL TYPE 1 DIABETIC BODYBUILDER…For years I have used these individual ingredients to help me balance blood sugar and take less insulin…The combination of this formula played a major role in …controlling my diabetes.” [this testimonial appears next to an image of your HumaSlin product]• A post dated January 13, 2018 - “What are the benefits of Humaslin?... Insulin Mimicking…Blood Sugar Regulation…”• A post dated July 5, 2018 - “It’s effective for regulating blood sugar levels, due to its high saponin content, and it’s also shown to control blood glucose levels…”• A post dated November 14, 2018 - “Brief backstory: the owner of #CondemnedLabz, Michael J., is a Type 1 Diabetic. HumaSlin was his attempt to reduce the need for exogenous insulin via natural insulin mimetics…”• A post dated November 25, 2019 - “Humalsim is an advanced insulin- . . . manipulating formula … regulating blood sugar levels…”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Arsyn, ConvictStim, Humaslin, Thyrogenic, and DNA Dispatch fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your products Arsyn and ConvictStim are labeled as dietary supplements. Even if your products Arsyn and ConvictStim did not have therapeutic claims that make these products unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, they would be adulterated dietary supplements.
The Supplement Facts panel on your product ConvictStim declares higenamine as a dietary ingredient in the product. Higenamine is a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)]. Further, as a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, higenamine is a “new dietary ingredient” under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that higenamine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, higenamine is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a) and (v)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that higenamine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing higenamine would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In fact, the available evidence underscores higenamine’s potential for serious cardiotoxic effects. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing higenamine are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(f)(1)(B].
Further, your Arsyn and ConvictStim product labels declare 2-aminoisoheptane hydrochloride (HCl) as an ingredient in each of the products and your Arsyn product label also declares hordenine HCl and higenamine HCl as an ingredient in your Arsyn product. Your Arsyn product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl are unsafe food additives under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)]. Your ConvictStim product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl is an unsafe food additive under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)].
If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(C)(i)].
The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. The ingredients 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)] because they are not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types. Neither are 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl GRAS under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because 2-aminoisoheptane HCl, hordenine HCl, and higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Arsyn and ConvictStim products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they contain one or more unsafe food additives. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Dear Mr. Baroody:
This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the following Internet address: www.holographichealth.com.

Formula,” “Brain Balance,” “Passionate Pursuit,” “Better Mood,” “Male Prosexual,” “Ear Well,” “Pink Lady,” “Eye-C,” and Hemorr-Norm.” The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.

It is not just excessive lifting or constipation. It is involved with many interrelated body systems. Among these are coccyx problems and bowel imbalances. I have also recommended this ointment for excessively rough cracking skin on the feet and hands with excellent results. It can also be used on eternal sores.
Unapproved New Drugs
Information on your website at www.holographichealth.com indicates that you intend to market your “Pink Lady” product as a dietary supplement. For example, “Pink Lady” is labeled with a Supplement Facts panel; however, it is marketed for topical use. “Pink Lady” does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)]. Only products that are intended solely for ingestion may be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements. Topical products and products intended to enter the body through the skin or mucosal tissues are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Pink Lady” is not a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)].
Your “Glyco-Well,” “Pan-Gest,” “Heart-Line,” “Aspara-Can,” “Cherry Gold,” “H.H.S. Formula,” “Brain Balance,” “Passionate Pursuit,” “Better Mood,” “Male Prosexual,” “Ear Well,” “Pink Lady,” “Eye-C,” and “Hemorr-Norm” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No approved applications are in effect for your products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your “Glyco-Well,” “Pan-Gest,” “Heart-Line,” “Aspara-Can,” “Cherry Gold,” “H.H.S. Formula,” “Brain Balance,” “Passionate Pursuit,” “Better Mood,” “Male Prosexual,” “Ear Well,” and “Pink Lady,” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)], in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Allison C. Hunter, Compliance Officer, 6751 Steger Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45237.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Sparling:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.fibromyalgiatreatmentgroup.com/landers/1/, www.fibrolief.com, www.neuropathytreatmentgroup.com and www.nerverenew.com in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Fibrolief Support Formula, Nerve Renew, Neuro Boost Optimizer, and Immune Support. We have also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/fibrolief, which directs customers to https://fibrolief.com/, to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Fibrolief Support Formula
Statements referring to Fibrolief Support Formula on www.fibrolief.com:
The product name, “Fibrolief Support Formula” (implies the product is intended for use in the mitigation and/or treatment of fibromyalgia)
“Reduce Debilitating Body Aches, Stiffness, Fatigue & More”
“Reduce chronic joint or muscle aches and stiffness”
Statements referring to Fibrolief Support Formula ingredients on www.fibrolief.com:
Turmeric (275mg): “…powerful anti-inflammatory and soothing properties to quickly reduce discomfort and swelling…safe alternative for acute pain relief comparable to acetaminophen.”
Boswellia Serrata (100mg): “Used for centuries to reduce joint and muscle discomfort, inflammation…and more.”
White Willow (90mg): “This extract is a natural alternative to aspirin that is safer and less irritating to the stomach lining.”
Celery Seed Extract (40mg): “Known to help reduce muscle spasms and alleviate painful gas and bloating. Researchers have found the compounds in celery have antioxidant characteristics and provide various healing benefits.”
SAM-e (65mg): “The University of Maryland Medical Center states, ‘SAMe can be effective in reducing…depressed mood.’”
Your www.fibrolief.com website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
“…I have had fibromyalgia for 15 years...A few months ago I learned about Fibrolief and decided to give it a try…The pain and fatigue have decreased perhaps by 70%. . ..”
“Fibrolief is the only thing that has helped with my fibromyalgia pain. I have been taking Fibrolief for years and it has given me my life back. I’m not totally free of pain, but it has decreased my pain by at least 80% with no side effects like with prescription drugs.”
Statements referring to Fibrolief Support Formula on www.fibromyalgiatreatmentgroup.com/landers/1/:
“I am going to show you how these ingredients have been shown to improve fibromyalgia symptoms and help you return to a normal life.”
“Reduction of lower back pain, headaches, joint and muscle pain…”
Statements referring to Fibrolief Support Formula ingredients on www.fibromyalgia treatmentgroup.com/landers/1/:
“What Enables The Ingredients In Fibrolief To Be So Effective At Relieving The Pain And Symptoms?”
“Fibrolief contains a combination of ingredients that…have helped many people achieve: Reduction of lower back pain, headaches, joint and muscle pain…”
Turmeric/Curcumin
“Curcumin is a potent anti-oxidant with insanely powerful anti-inflammatory and pain relieving properties. This marvel of nature has virtually no side-effects and offers vast benefits to fibromyalgia sufferers. . ..”
Boswellia AKBA (ApresFlex(C))
“Boswellia is a popular herb used for its benefits in fighting inflammation. Its anti-inflammatory effects involve many processes that the body uses to help heal itself, and could correlate to benefiting many chronic illnesses, such as arthritis and fibromyalgia.”
“Boswellia Serrata extract providing Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) has been shown to increase joint mobility and ease stiff joints.”
White Willow Bark Extract
“White Willow Bark extract contains the active ingredient salicin which is a Cox-1 and Cox-2 inhibitor, and acts as an anti-inflammatory and also reduces pain by inhibiting prostaglandins. Animal experimentation at Cairo University compared willow bark extract to ASA (aspirin), and found that willow bark was equally or more effective as aspirin [sic] at reducing inflammation; even though the salicin content was lower than an equivalent dose of ASA. It is recommended to take white willow bark instead of aspirin because it is less irritating to the stomach lining.”
Celery Seed Extract
“Celery seed extract has been used as a pain reliever for arthritis, fibromyalgia and gout. It is known to help reduce muscle spasms and to alleviate painful gas and bloating. It is also known to aid in improving the painful symptoms of fibromyalgia sufferers by reducing inflammation.”
“Celery seed contains a number of biologically beneficial substance [sic], including flavonoids high in antioxidants, coumarin with anti-coagulating effects, volatile oils ,omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid, and the powerful healing compound 3-n-butylphthlaide (3-n-B). 3-n-B is extremely effective at reducing the action of the COX-1, COX-2, and 5-LOX pain triggers. In one study of patients with longterm joint discomfort, celery seed helped reduce tenderness and improve flexibility in a remarkable 68% of patients.”Rhodiola Rosea
“[R]hodiola is typically used for fatigue, depression, sleep problems, poor attention span and poor memory.”
Bacopa Monnieri
“In a 2008 study of older adults, researchers found that 12 weeks of supplementation with bacopa led to significant improvements in memory, depression, anxiety, and heart rate. In a 2001 study of healthy adults, participants showed significant improvements in…memory, learning and anxiety.”
SAM-e“Studies have shown its [sic] effective for arthritis pain and shows both analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties.”
“Europe has had SAM-e available by prescription for many years as an antidepressant, and it has been available over-the-counter in the US since 1996. Dr. Ascanio Polimeni, a renowned physician in Rome, Italy, stated that ‘... doctors in Europe prescribe SAM-e for the therapy of many conditions, including depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia.’”
“The University of Maryland Medical Center states, ‘SAMe can be effective in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia - including pain, fatigue, morning stiffness, and depressed mood.’”
Vitamin D3
“It is an essential ingredient in reducing the symptoms of fibromyalgia.”
Stabilized R-Alpha Lioic Acid
“B vitamins and R-ALA are absolutely essential ingredients in helping to reduce the symptoms of fibromyalgia and ease nerve pain.”
Black Pepper Bioperine
“Bioperine…has immune-suppressing, tumor-inhibiting, and antidepressant effects.”
Your www.fibromyalgiatreatmentgroup.com/landers/1/ website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
“I tried your Fibrolief and I’m finally sleeping through the night. Doctors only gave me pain meds and sleep meds and I thought I was losing my mind. The pain throughout my body is mostly gone now, and my energy has returned.”
“I have been quite distressed with all the body pains and constant fatigue. After working my way through 5 doctors at a major hospital in Reno, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Many of the medications did not help. Thankfully, I tried Fibrolief. This has been a major factor in dramatically decreasing the pain that I had. My energy has returned and I am again doing the things I love.”
“I have suffered with fibromyalgia for nearly four years. I was first diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome, but after the pain and other symptoms persisted, my doctor finally got the diagnosis right…The pain finally started to ease off after taking your product for about six weeks. I will continue using this as it is the first time in three years that I have felt so hopeful.”
“I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia in March of 2010. At that time I was suffering from severe pain and had no energy…I fell into depression which lasted a few years. My doctor prescribed me pain meds and anti-depressants, but they never really helped my condition…So I looked around on the internet and came across Fibrolief…I signed up for the 2 week trial…I did start to notice a difference in about 2 months…So I would definitely advise anyone with fibromyalgia to give Fibrolief a chance.”

“Here are just a handful of some of the many benefits identified in clinical studies of this powerful ingredient:…help fight chronic inflammation…Reversed immune system paralysis in patients whose immune systems had been compromised from sepsis.”
Your Fibrolief Support Formula, Nerve Renew, Neuro Boost Optimizer, and Immune Support products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d), § 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Fibrolief Support Formula, Nerve Renew, Neuro Boost Optimizer, and Immune Support are intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Fibrolief Support Formula, Nerve Renew, Neuro Boost Optimizer, and Immune Support fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Additionally, your website www.fibromyalgiatreatmentgroup.com/landers/1/ includes the statement, “Our manufacturing facility is FDA approved. . ..” FDA does not approve dietary supplement manufacturing facilities. Therefore, this statement is false or misleading. Even if your Fibrolief Support Formula were not an unapproved new and misbranded drug, it would be a misbranded food under section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: CDR Joshua Wireman, Compliance Officer, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021-4421. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact CDR Joshua Wireman at 425-302-0345.

RE: 616186
Dear Mr. McDaniel and Ms. Shields:
This letter is to advise you that in July 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your product labeling and your website at the Internet address www.mcdanielwater.com and has observed that you take orders there for the product “Black Indian Salve,” which you also refer to on your website as “Indian Herb,” “X,” and “Black Salve.” As explained further below, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 301(d). You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Your “Black Indian Salve” is concerning from a public health perspective because it is labeled to contain the ingredients bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis) and zinc chloride. Both substances are known corrosive agents. The combination of bloodroot and zinc chloride results in a corrosive topical agent capable of indiscriminately damaging healthy and diseased tissue alike and forming eschar (sloughed dead tissue). The tissue necrosis caused by topical application of products containing such ingredients (often referred to as ""black salves"") is well-documented.
On May 16, 2019, the FDA issued a warning letter to McDaniel Life-Line LLC which offered a similar product, “Indian Herb,” for sale directly to consumers. The agency advises you that on February 8, 2019, “Indian Herb” was the subject of a voluntary worldwide recall of all lots of the product that were within expiration. In addition, the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) issued a safety alert on February 12, 2019 concerning the potential safety hazard associated with “Indian Herb” (see Indian Herb FDA Alert).
Unapproved New Drug Violations
You market “Black Indian Salve” as a dietary supplement with directions for both topical application and for ingestion. However, “Black Indian Salve” does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act. Only products that are intended solely for ingestion may be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements. See section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)(i). Topical products and products intended to enter the body through the skin or mucosal tissues are not dietary supplements. Therefore, your “Black Indian Salve” is not a dietary supplement.
Rather, claims on your product labeling and your website establish that “Black Indian Salve” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or to affect the structure or function of the body. Examples of claims on your product label and website that establish the intended use of your “Black Indian Salve” product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Black Indian Salve
From the package insert accompanying the product:
• “The following guidelines are offered for the application of ‘The Black Indian Salve’ in treating various types of abnormal growths both external and internal. . . . This is how people have used the ‘Black Indian Salve’ on external growths . . . The ‘Black Indian Salve’ is tracing out the infected area and drawing the poison back into the nucleus. It will make a hard core, similar to the core of a boil – hard and rubbery. The redness will diminish and a white ring will begin to appear around the nucleus. . . . Between the fifth and seventh day, a white ring will start to separate from the healthy tissue and become very loose. . . . Usually after the second application the growth itself is dead. The growth will become more painful as the body begins to eject its dying tissue. Swelling often occurs. . . . The core will not come out unless the whole growth is dead and detached from the healthy tissue. Then and only then will it come out intact. There will be no need for surgery. . . . For most people, in about 10 days the body completely pushes out the dead growth and the fever disappears. . . During the next 10 days, or as long as it takes, the body will fill in the cavity with either healthy tissue or scar tissue, depending on the individual’s body chemistry and health. . . . In many cases of removing external growths, people report that even though large masses of tissue was ejected from the body, even to the point of revealing the muscle structure below, bleeding did not occur and the body completely filled in the area where the growth had been.”
From the website http://mcdanielwater.com/page12.html:
• “The Indian Herb is a 100-year-old folk remedy used to attack disease and aid in the healing process. It is also often referred to as ‘X’ or ‘Black Salve’. Indian Herb may be taken internally or applied externally to abnormal skin growths.”• “Yellow Dockcontains iron and can improve the function of the liver, kidneys, lymph glands and intestines. It has been used for the treatment of jaundice . . ..”• “Blood Rootis considered highly effective for skin conditions . . . Its primary alkaloid, sanguinarine, has been found to be a potent anti-cancer agent. It is prized for its ability to heal infections & stimulate healthy tissue growth.”• “Licorice Roothas been known to enhance immunity by boosting the level of interferon.”• “Galangal. . . In recent studies, it was also found to have anti-cancer activities. It acts as an anti-oxidant and suppresses the genotoxicity of chemicals. Genotoxic substances are known to be potentially mutagenic or potentially cancerous.”
Your “Black Indian Salve” product is also a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because it is not generally recognized as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Under section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA. There is no FDA-approved application in effect for your “Black Indian Salve.” Thus, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Ref. # CMS 611994
Dear Jason Duran and Markus Trillsch,
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at http://americanmetabolix.com in June 2021 and has determined that you take orders for the products Muscle Test, Banish, Ketogenic Diet Aid, Keto Friendly Collagen, Exile Euphoric Weight Loss, Exile Super Shock, Havok Hardcore, and Keto Pump in Watermelon and Grape Flavors. The claims on your website establish that the Muscle Test, Banish, Ketogenic Diet Aid, and Keto Friendly Collagen products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. In addition, as explained further below, the Exile Euphoric Weight Loss, Exile Super Shock, Havok Hardcore, and Keto Pump in Watermelon and Grape Flavors products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)].
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New and Misbranded Drugs
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Muscle Test

On your product page for Keto Friendly Collagen at http://americanmetabolix.com:

Adding hydrolyzed collagen [an ingredient in your Keto Friendly Collagen] . . . helps your joints move more easily, . . . reduces pain, and rebuilds and repairs connective tissue”
Your Muscle Test, Banish, Ketogenic Diet Aid, and Keto Friendly Collagen products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Muscle Test and Ketogenic Diet Aid products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Muscle Test and Ketogenic Diet Aid fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your Exile Super Shock, Havok Hardcore BombSicle, and Keto Pump in Watermelon and Grape Flavors are labeled as dietary supplements and offered for sale on your website, http://americanmetabolix.com. The Supplement Facts label for each of these products lists Hordenine Hydrochloride (HCl) as an ingredient, and the Supplement Facts label for your Exile Super Shock product also lists Higenamine Hydrochloride (HCl) as an ingredient.
As such, your Exile Super Shock, Havok Hardcore BombSicle, and Keto Pump in Watermelon and Grape Flavors products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because the ingredients Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl are unsafe food additives under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 348(a)]. If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(a)(C)(i)].
The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. The ingredients Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(1)] because they are not vitamins, minerals, amino acids, herbs or other botanicals, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types.
Neither are Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl GRAS under their conditions of use in your dietary supplement products. Because Hordenine HCl and Higenamine HCl do not qualify as dietary ingredients and are not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Exile Super Shock, Havok Hardcore BombSicle, and Keto Pump in Watermelon and Grape Flavors products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

RE: 614538
Dear Ms. Stacy Sanchez:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website athttps://holistichealeronline.com/ in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your Diabalance Diabetes Supplement product. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your website in August 2021.
The claims on your website establish that this product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
• “Diabalance Diabetes Supplement” (Product name)• “The key ingredients are a helpful aid to people who have diabetes and hypoglycemia.”• “Blood sugar rises. . .It may lower elevated blood pressure. . .”• “The Bitter Melon, Dandelion, Bilberry and Ginkgo biloba in this vegetarian capsule helps balance blood sugar levels for people with diabetes.”• “The combination of these ingredients helps with blood sugar control. . .”• “Works great to lower high blood sugar. . .”• “We recommend people with type 2 diabetes or those who are experiencing insulin resistance to opt for this holistic diabetes treatment.”• “For those with type 2 diabetes. . .”
Your Diabalance Diabetes Supplement product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product Diabalance Diabetes Supplement is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self‐diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, Diabalance Diabetes Supplement fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply to the above violations should be directed to Rob Genzel Jr. with the FDA via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.
FTC Cease and Desist Demand:In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has determined that it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well‐controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.

More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. See Daniel Chapter One, WL 5160000 at *17‐19.
The FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited above may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Notice is hereby given that you must cease and desist from making any claim that a product and prevent, treat, or cure diabetes without competent and reliable scientific evidence consisting of well‐controlled human clinical studies substantiating that the claims are true. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or Administrative Cease and Desist Order. In addition, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of a disease may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation pursuant to Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b). With regard to the advertising claims discussed above, please notify Richard Cleland of the FTC via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address FTC's concerns.

RE: 614576
Dear Mr. Tom Redmond III:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.diabetesdoctor.com, in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your “Diabetes Doctor Pre-Diabetes” and “Diabetes Doctor Blood Sugar 24 Hour” products. We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/naturaldiabetesdoctor and https://www.instagram.com/diabetesdoctor/, which direct consumers to your website www.diabetesdoctor.com to purchase your products. Additionally, we reviewed products listings and seller profile on your Walmart webpage on https://www.walmart.com/, and your product listings and seller profile on your Amazon storefront on https://www.Amazon.com, both which you operate under the name, “Diabetes Doctor”. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.
The claims on your website, social media webpages, Amazon storefront, and Walmart webpage establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your “Diabetes Doctor Pre-Diabetes” product page on your website:• “Fights Insulin Resistance”• “Maintain healthy function of vital diabetes organs”• “Curcumin/Turmeric [ingredient in product]…In a research study of people with pre- diabetes, taking curcumin for 9-months significantly reduced the number of prediabetic individuals who eventually developed Type 2 diabetes. Curcumin treatment appeared to support healthy function of β-cells, the insulin producing cells of the pancreas.”• “Magnesium [ingredient in product]...Research shows that a 100 mg/day increase in magnesium intake is associated with a 15% risk reduction for developing type 2 diabetes…”• “Vitamin D3 [ingredient in product] Clinical research has demonstrated that in people without diabetes, increasing blood levels of vitamin D is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Our formula uses the activated form of Vitamin D (D3).”
On your “Diabetes Doctor Blood Sugar 24 Hour” product page on your website:• “Studies have shown cassia cinnamon [ingredient in product] at high doses can reduce fasting blood sugars by 25mg/dL• “Milk Thistle [ingredient in product] … has been clinically proven to fight resistance for significant benefits on blood sugar health”o “Lower fasting blood sugars by 11%”o “Lower insulin needs by 14%”o “Lower HbA1C by 1.5%”o “Lower abnormal liver enzymes in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease”o “Lower protein in the urine (marker of kidney damage) in patients with diabetic kidney disease”• “Bilberry [ingredient in product] …shown improved retinal (eye) circulatory health in adults with diabetic retinopathy after 6 months”• “Banaba [ingredient in product] acts as a natural insulin sensitizer to support healthy blood sugar and A1C . …[B]anaba can reduce blood sugars by 30%, and A1C by 0.65%”
On your social media Facebook page:• “Research shows that cinnamon [ingredient in product] does NOT work to lower blood sugars….. unless used at doses of 500-1000 mg/day! Blood Sugar 24 Hour Support includes Cinnamon at the right dose (750 mg/day)” [August 4, 2020]• In the comments an individual asks, “Can this be taken as a diabetes preventative?” and Diabetes Doctor responds with “Check out our products for Pre Diabetes https://diabetesdoctor.com/collections/pre-diabetes” [August 4, 2020]On your social media Instagram page:• “[C]omprehensive product that is designed to help you meet your daily diabetes needs from blood sugar control to diabetes specific organ health …. help that insulin function better and cut through insulin resistance …” [March 5, 2021]

Help maintain healthy blood sugar levels …which helps your body’s natural insulin work better.”• “This product is not only a multivitamin but has been specifically designed to target the root cause of high blood sugar and Type 2 diabetes”
Your “Diabetes Doctor Pre-Diabetes” and “Diabetes Doctor Blood Sugar 24 Hour” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product “Diabetes Doctor Pre-Diabetes” and “Diabetes Doctor Blood Sugar 24 Hour” products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Diabetes Doctor Pre-Diabetes” and “Diabetes Doctor Blood Sugar 24 Hour” products fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

Your “Berry Gen Sugar Control” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product ““Berry Gen Sugar Control” is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Berry Gen Sugar Control” product fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

RE: 614542
Dear Mr. Ron Elul:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://curalife.com/ in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your CuraLin product. In addition, FDA reviewed your social media websites, https://www.instagram.com/curalife/ and https://www.facebook.com/curalife/ which direct consumers to your website https://curalife.com/ to purchase your product. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish that this product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
• “[P]romote healthy glycemic response. . ."" (the product label)• ""CuraLin offers people needing advanced glucose support an effective. . .option for maintaining healthy glucose levels. . .""• “89% would recommend CuraLin to a diabetic friend”• “Turmeric [described as an ingredient in your CuraLin product] has been used . . . to help people maintain healthy glucose levels though [sic] healthy insulin tolerance.""• ""Bitter Melon [described as an ingredient in your CuraLin product] is . . . used by diabetes [sic]in Eastern medicinal systems. Its mechanism of action . . . supports glucose absorption, and the sensitivity of the muscle cells to insulin.""• ""Fenugreek [described as an ingredient in your CuraLin product] . . . promotes insulin production, release & sensitivity.""• ""Picrorhiza Kurroa [described as an ingredient in your CuraLin product] . . . supports healthy glucose tolerance . . .""
On your social media Instagram page:
• “An herb with powerful health benefits like maintaining blood sugar levels and cholesterol, Fenugreek is a key component in our Curalin supplements.""
Your Instagram page also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of “CuraLin” for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. An example of such testimonial include:
• ""I am taking them daily and feel that they are some help in controlling my blood sugar . . . #beatingdiabetes . . .""
On your social media Facebook page:
• “The right nutritional supplement for the specific condition can provide a sustainable solution for managing your glucose levels. Empower your lifestyle by managing your Type 2 Diabetes naturally!”
Your CuraLin product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product CuraLin is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes.Accordingly, CuraLin, fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

Your DiabetesSupport product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product DiabetesSupport is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self‐diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, DiabetesSupport, fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to address these matters. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.

RE: 614578
Dear Mr. Abdur‐Rahmaan Felder:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://www.ar‐rahmahpharm.com/ in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your Diabetes Support product. In addition, FDA reviewed your social media websites, https://www.instagram.com/arrahmahpharm/, and https://www.facebook.com/ArRahmahPharm which directs consumers to your website https://www.ar‐rahmahpharm.com/ to purchase your product. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish that this product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
• “DIABETES SUPPORT (your product name) . . . Diabetes is caused when the body either resists insulin or does not produce enough; either of which can lead to unbalanced blood glucose levels. Our diabetes support formula assists in keeping blood sugar at an optimum level. ..... Diabetes Support helps to balance blood glucose levels.”• “May help balance Blood Sugar Levels”On your social media Instagram page:
• “Herbs such as those in our Diabetes support formula have been scientifically shown to support healthy blood sugar levels.”• “Provide supplemental nutrients to the pancreas for balancing insulin and glucagon.""• “Our diabetes support formula assists in keeping blood sugar at an optimum level. This wonderful blend . . . makes blood sugar management easier. With nutrient dense herbs . . . Diabetes Support helps to balance blood glucose levels.""

Dear Mr. Joseph Esposito:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://aceva.com/ in August 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your Sugar Balance product. In addition, FDA reviewed your social media websites, https://twitter.com/acevahealth and https://www.facebook.com/acevanutrition, which direct consumers to your website https://aceva.com/ to purchase your product. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.
The claims on your website and social media websites establish that this product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
On your “Sugar Balance” product page on your website:• “Sugar Balances helps improve insulin sensitivity and enhance blood sugar control.”• “[F]or improved A1c levels and glycemic control.”• “Regulating Blood Sugar. . .”• “Sugar Balance is a clinically‐effective formula containing powerful ingredients designed to improve insulin sensitivity and enhance blood glucose (sugar) control.”

On your social media Facebook page:• “If you need to decrease your body's need for insulin, use Sugar Balance""• “Help get your Diabetes under control. Sugar Balance is a clinically effective formula containing powerful ingredients designed to improve insulin sensitivity and enhance blood glucose (sugar) control.”
Your Sugar Balance product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product Sugar Balance is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self‐diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes.
Accordingly, your Sugar Balance product fails to bear adequate direction for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all‐inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your product. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address these matters may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply to the above violations should be directed to Rob Genzel Jr. with the FDA via email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov. If you have any questions, you may also email at CFSANResponse@fda.hhs.gov.
FTC Cease and Desist Demand:In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has determined that it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well‐controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. POM Wonderful LLC, 155 F.T.C. 1, 60‐61, (2013), aff’d in relevant part, 777 F.3d 478 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Daniel Chapter One, FTC Dkt. No. 9239, 2009 WL 5160000 at *16‐19 (F.T.C.

More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. See Daniel Chapter One, WL 5160000 at *17‐19.
The FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited above may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Notice is hereby given that you must cease and desist from making any claim that a product and prevent, treat, or cure diabetes without competent and reliable scientific evidence consisting of well‐controlled human clinical studies substantiating that the claims are true. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or Administrative Cease and Desist Order. In addition, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of a disease may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation pursuant to Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b).
With regard to the advertising claims discussed above, please notify Richard Cleland of the FTC via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter of the specific actions you have taken to address FTC's concerns.

WARNING LETTERRE: 614517
Dear Mr. John Burd,
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, https://lysulin.com/, in August 2021and has determined that you take orders there for your “Lysulin Weight Loss Shake,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Chewables,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Liquid,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Capsules,” and “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Powder” products. We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.instagram.com/lysulin_usa/ and https://www.facebook.com/lysulindiabetesmanagement, which direct consumers to your website https://lysulin.com/ to purchase your products. Additionally, we reviewed your seller profile and product listings on your Amazon storefront on www.Amazon.com, which you operate under the name, “Lysulin, Inc.” You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in August 2021.
The claims on your website, social media webpages, and Amazon storefront establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include:
On the homepage, section “What’s in Lysulin?”:• “The combination and high level of these active ingredients have been shown to help maintain healthy A1c blood sugar levels in diabetics and prediabetics.”• “Lysulin is patented and proven in a human clinical study to help people with diabetes and prediabetes maintain healthy levels of A1c blood sugar.”
On the webpage titled, “Lysulin ® Weight Loss Shake” under Details:• “[D]aily serving of patented Lysulin ® to reduce blood glucose”• “The Lysulin® Weight Loss Shake is the ONLY SHAKE with the patented Lysulin® ingredient to reduce Glucose from the blood stream …”
Under Label & Specifications:• “Drink this shake every day … daily serving of patented Lysulin® to reduce blood glucose”• “Reduces Glucose in the blood stream”
On your social media Instagram page:• “Lysulin Nutritional Support for People With Diabetes & Prediabetes”• “Lysulin…clinically shown to help people with diabetes or pre-diabetes…works like a sponge to remove Glucose from your bloodstream…#type2diabetic #diabetescare …#insulindependent #diabetes #insulinresistance…” [April 26, 2021]• “What is Lysulin? Formulated by a renowned diabetes scientist, Lysulin … help maintain healthy A1c blood sugar levels in diabetics and pre-diabetics.” [August 20, 2020]
Your social media Instagram page also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:• “I am 64 years old and have Type 1 diabetes… I just finished my one month trial of Lysulin and am pleased to report that my starting HbA1c of 10.5% in October dropped to 9.5% in just one month. I plan to keep using Lysulin to see how low I can get my HbA1c.…” [November 27, 2018]• “I have had Type 2 diabetes since May 2017… My HbA1c was 7.4 in October of 2017. I tested my HbA1c with the home HbA1c test kit on 9-16-18 and it was 6.6% I started taking Lysulin and on 11-12-18 the lab tested my HbA1c and it had dropped to 6.2% …” [December 4, 2018]
On your social media Facebook page:• “Lysulin Weight Loss Shake Nutritional Support For Diabetics & Prediabetics”• “Let Lysulin be your partner for better diabetes management”• “Lysulin provides people with diabetes and pre-diabetes with the nutritional support they need to maintain healthy levels of Insulin Resistance and A1c.”• “Our mission at Lysulin is to help people with Prediabetes or Type 2 Diabetes prevent, manage, or in some cases even completely reverse the disease.”
Your social media Facebook page also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of products for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:• “This has really helped lower my blood sugars. … Just had my lab work done and my a1c went from 7.8 to 6.2 …” [February 24, 2021]• “I have had Type 2 diabetes for over 20 years and have had health problems due to my diabetes. I am very satisfied with Lysulin after using for 2 months …” [February 13, 2021]
On your Amazon.com storefront product page for “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Capsules”:• “Lysulin… Natural Diabetic Formula to Lower Blood Glucose for Type 2 Diabetes Or Prediabetes…”• “BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL: Lysulin helps lower blood glucose, glycated proteins, and A1c levels for people with type 2 diabetes, prediabetes, and anyone at risk of developing diabetes and metabolic syndrome.”• “IMPROVE LIPIDS AND BLOOD PRESSURE: Lysulin… and shown to lower blood glucose and HbA1c levels.”• “Lysulin is an all natural supplement to lower blood sugar”• “CLINICALLY TESTED: “… Lysulin can help to lower blood glucose and A1c levels while improving the lipid profile in prediabetes and diabetes”
Your “Lysulin ® Weight Loss Shake,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Chewables,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Liquid,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Capsules,” and “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Powder” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product ““Lysulin ® Weight Loss Shake,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Chewables,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Liquid,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Capsules,” and “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Powder” are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that, with certain exceptions not applicable here, are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your “Lysulin ® Weight Loss Shake,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Chewables,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Liquid,” “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Capsules,” and “Lysulin Diabetes and Prediabetes Powder” products fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations.

If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

WARNING LETTER

Ms. Gonzalez:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed your firm’s websites at www.fastweightlossgarcinia.com and www.ketoultraslimplus.com between June and July 2021 and has determined that your firm takes orders there for ""Genesis Ultra Gold.""  We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/genesisultraslim,https://twitter.com/genesis_slim andwww.instagram.com/genesis_slim/; these social media websites direct consumers to your websitewww.fastweightlossgarcinia.com1to purchase your products.  The claims on your websites and social media websites establish that your ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" product isintended for weight loss. Therefore, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d), and a misbranded drug sold in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 502 and 331(a). You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold""contains undeclared sibutramine and phenolphthalein. Sibutramine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Meridia, a new drug approved by FDA for marketing in 1997 for prescription treatment of obesity and, subsequently, withdrawn from the United States market on December 21, 2010 after clinical data indicated sibutramine poses an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.  Phenolphthalein is a chemical that is not an active ingredient in any approved drug in the United States.  Studies have indicated that it presents a cancer-causing risk.
FDA has issued a warning to consumers not to use""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold""(see Genesis Ultra Slim Gold Immediate Public Notification).
Unapproved New Drug
You market""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold""as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii), a dietary supplement may not include an article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before it was authorized for investigation as a new drug.
The investigational new drug (IND) application for Meridia (sibutramine) was received by FDA on December 24, 1985, and sibutramine became authorized for investigation as a new drug under an IND on January 23, 1986.  When Meridia was approved for marketing as a new drug in the United States, the existence of substantial completed clinical investigations of sibutramine became public.  Based on the information available to FDA, sibutramine was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food until after it was authorized for investigation as a new drug.  Therefore, ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold,"" which contains sibutramine, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act.
Your""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold,""is an article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or function of the body and, thus, is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1).  Some examples of claims observed on your websites and social media websites that establish the intended use of your product as a drug include, but may not limited to, the following:
On your websites www.fastweightlossgarcinia.com and www.ketoultraslimplus.com
""Our natural blend of ingredients can benefit you by . . . [s]uppressing your appetite . . . [b]oosts your metabolism . . . [b]urn fat & calories . . . [i]ncrease energy levels . . .""

Your ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore it is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p).  With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There is no FDA-approved application in effect for your product.
Misbranded Drug
Your “Genesis Ultra Slim Gold” product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that the labeling for this drug fails to bear adequate directions for use.  “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5).  It is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" for at least two reasons:  1) prior to withdrawal of Meridia’s approval, FDA approval of sibutramine was limited to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs and 2) FDA approval of Meridia was withdrawn because of serious safety risks.  As such, the labeling of ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" fails to bear adequate directions for its intended uses, causing it to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.  Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" product is not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bears adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved application is in effect for this product.
Additionally, under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular.  Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n) provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations . . ..” Your ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act because the labeling fails to reveal its sibutramine and phenolphthalein content, which are material facts with respect to consequences that may result from the use of this product.  As described above, sibutramine and phenolphthalein may pose health risks to consumers which are only compounded by the fact that neither ingredient is declared on the label.
""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" is also misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because the product labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users.  As noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of this product, particularly since someone who takes it would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared ingredients.
Likewise, ""Genesis Ultra Slim Gold"" is misbranded under section 502(j) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(j), because it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner recommended in the labeling.  As previously noted, sibutramine poses an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

While FDA has not tested these products marketed by your firm, you are responsible for ensuring that they do not contain undeclared ingredients.

WARNING LETTER
August 11, 2021
Dear Ms. Orozco:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration has reviewed your website at https://jedoisavoir2020.com in June 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for “365 Skinny High Intensity.” We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/jdl2020 and www.instagram.com/j_d_l2020; these social media websites direct consumers to your website https://jedoisavoir2020.com to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your “365 Skinny High Intensity” product is intended for weight loss. Therefore, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d), and a misbranded drug sold in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 502 and 331(a). You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “365 Skinny High Intensity” contains undeclared sibutramine. Sibutramine is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Meridia, a new drug approved by FDA for marketing in 1997 for prescription treatment of obesity and, subsequently, withdrawn from the United States market on December 21, 2010 after clinical data indicated sibutramine poses an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
FDA has issued a warning to consumers not to use “365 Skinny High Intensity” (see 365 Skinny High Intensity Immediate Public Notification).
Unapproved New Drug
You market “365 Skinny High Intensity” as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii), a dietary supplement may not include an article authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before it was authorized for investigation as a new drug.
The investigational new drug (IND) application for Meridia (sibutramine) was received by FDA on December 24, 1985, and sibutramine became authorized for investigation as a new drug under an IND on January 23, 1986. When Meridia was approved for marketing as a new drug in the United States, the existence of substantial completed clinical investigations of sibutramine became public. Based on the information available to FDA, sibutramine was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food until after it was authorized for investigation as a new drug. Therefore, “365 Skinny High Intensity,” which contains sibutramine, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act.
Your “365 Skinny High Intensity,” is an article intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease and/or an article (other than food) intended to affect the structure or function of the body and, thus, is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1). Some examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your product as a drug include, but may not limited to, the following:
On your website https://jedoisavoir2020.com• “365 Skinny High Intensity new silver label Strong Formula 2020 are [sic] giving excellent results in the loss of weight with a single capsule a day!”
On your website https://jedoisavoir2020.com and Facebook Account, www.facebook.com/jdl2020, October 19, 2020 Post• “It is a totally natural herbal supplement for anti obesity that controls anxiety, inhibits appetite, burns fat, high cholesterol, helps with sugar levels, accelerates metabolism, eliminates toxins, reduce swelling and increase your energy.”• “How does this capsule work? . . . Appetite Control . . . Accelerates metabolism . . . Increase your energy . . . Causes satiety . . . Burn fat through the urine . . . Eliminates toxins in the skin . . . Regenerates muscle mass . . . Reduces fat deposits and cellulite . . . Increases libido . . . Balances insulin and blood sugar levels”• “Bitter orange extract: reduces ‘bad’ cholesterol prevents digestive disorders and regulates bowel movement” [sic]• “Cassia seed: combat constipation”• “Alism: eliminates fluid retention, reduces appetite”
Your “365 Skinny High Intensity” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for its above referenced uses and, therefore it is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There is no FDA-approved application in effect for your product.
Misbranded Drug
Your “365 Skinny High Intensity” product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that the labeling for this drug fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5). It is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for “365 Skinny High Intensity” for at least two reasons: 1) prior to withdrawal of Meridia’s approval, FDA approval of sibutramine was limited to use under the professional supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs and 2) FDA approval of Meridia was withdrawn because of serious safety risks. As such, the labeling of “365 Skinny High Intensity” fails to bear adequate directions for its intended uses, causing it to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your “365 Skinny High Intensity” product is not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bears adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved application is in effect for this product.
Additionally, under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(n) provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations . . ..” Your “365 Skinny High Intensity” product is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act because the labeling fails to reveal the sibutramine content, which is a material fact with respect to consequences that may result from the use of this product. As described above, sibutramine may pose health risks to consumers which are only compounded by the fact that the ingredient is not declared on the label.
“365 Skinny High Intensity” is also misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(2), because the product labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of this product, particularly since someone who takes it would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared ingredients.
Likewise, “365 Skinny High Intensity” is misbranded under section 502(j) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(j), because it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner recommended in the labeling. As previously noted, sibutramine poses an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Frisella,
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.1stphorm.com in March 2021. Based on our review of your website, we have found serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. As explained further below, introducing or delivering the products discussed below for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs / Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.1stphorm.com in March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for your products Whole Heart Cardiovascular Health Formula and Full-Mega Omega-3 Fish Oil. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your product webpage for Whole Heart Cardiovascular Health Formula, the following statements were found on the product description page https://1stphorm.com/collections/heart-health/products/whole-heart.
“Whole Heart is a pharmaceutical-grade blend of ingredients designed to . . . combat cardiovascular disease and heart attacks.”
“[The natural substances in Whole Heart are also key components in helping treat arthritis and other common issues like acne and skin-diseases.”
“We formulated Whole Heart to help decrease unhealthy levels of LDL cholesterol.”
” Regular use ofWhole Heart can revamp your body’s blood flow and help decrease cholesterol production.”
“Narrowing of the arteries increases resistance can lead to high blood pressure, the silent killer. To help remedy this, the ingredients in Whole Heart were carefully chosen because of their ability to lower inflammation and prevent the breakdown of nitric oxide, which can result in decreased blood pressure levels.”
[product label image] “IMPROVE LDL/HDL Ratio”
On your product webpage for Full-Mega Omega-3 Fish Oil, the following statements were found on the product description page https://1stphorm.com/collections/heart-health/products/full-mega.
“Studies on fish oils rich in both EPA and DHA have shown they help with lowering blood pressure, reducing triglyceride levels, lowering “bad” cholesterol (LDL) levels . . ..”
“The results of clinical studies have shown that they can be used to treat symptoms of ADHD as well as to combat symptoms of depression.”
“Omega-3 fish oils rich in EPA and DHA have been shown to improve your body’s natural anti-inflammatory response. They can also be used to reverse the symptoms of many conditions that are triggered by inflammation, such as asthma and psoriasis. Help boost your body’s natural anti-inflammatory response . . . by supplementing daily with Full-Mega.”
[product label image] “REDUCE Inflammation” and “MODERATE Cholesterol Levels”
Your Whole Heart Cardiovascular Health Formula and Full-Mega Omega-3 Fish Oil products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. A new drug is approved by the FDA based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Whole Heart Cardiovascular Health Formula and Full-Mega Omega-3 Fish Oil products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes.
Accordingly, Whole Heart Cardiovascular Health Formula and Full-Mega Omega-3 Fish Oil products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your MegaWatt V2, Thyro-Drive, 1-Db Overdrive Fastpack, 1-Db Goddess, and 1-Db Overdrive & Thyro-Drive products are adulterated within the meaning of section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)]. The Supplement Facts labels for each of these products declares hordenine as a dietary ingredient. Hordenine is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(B)] and a “new dietary ingredient” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that hordenine was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, hordenine is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that hordenine will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing hordenine would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing hordenine are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

Dear Mr. Marold:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.chill6.com in July 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the product Chill6, including flavors Margarita Lime, Watermelon Jolly, Orange Mango, and Pink Lemonade. The claims on your website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Additionally, even if your Chill6 were not an unapproved new drug and misbranded drug, it would be an adulterated food and misbranded food, as described below.
Introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drug and Misbranded Drug
Examples of some of the claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Within the Chill6 homepage of your website (https://www.chill6.com/):
“Did you know Chill6™ is great to lower anxiety during benzo and alcohol withdrawal?”
“Phenibut [which you list as an ingredient in Chill6] has been used safely in Russia for over 50 years . . . safely treating hundreds of thousands of people for a variety of disorders, including; anxiety, insomnia, . . . alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).”
“It [L-taurine] just might however contend as one of the healthiest amino acids for your body, offering a very long list of health benefits, including . . . cholesterol lowering affects.”
Within the Chill6 FAQs section of your website (https://www.chill6.com/pages/faqs):
“Chill6™ is a great anti-anxiety drink . . .. But Chill6™ is literally an anti anxiety, (it doesn’t make you calm, it takes away your anxiety therefore any anxiety related ailment would be worth a try [sic]. Chill6™ has helped many soldier’s (sic) with PTSD, and is outstanding for socially anxiety . . .. Additionally, Chill6™ reduces anxiety produced by benzodiazepine and alcohol withdrawal symptoms for people trying to reduce their physical addiction to them. This is often done by doctor's [sic] when withdrawing someone from alcohol. The doctor will prescribe a benzodiazepine to heighten the seizure threshold and reduce agonizing withdrawal symptoms.”
Within the Our Mission section of your website (https://www.chill6.com/pages/teamchill6):
“Chill6™ was discovered after one man found great success with a blend of amino acids that reduced his anxiety and vitalized his body while coming off his current prescription strength anti anxiety medication (benzodiazepines). The result Chill6™, the world’s first anti-anxiety & vitality drink, made from six amino acids.”
“. . . Chill6™ users see this is a serious product, with amazing benefits, in just over 5 years selling Chill6™, we have many physicians worldwide who recommend Chill6™ for various anxiety related ailments.”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Chill6 for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
Within the Chill6 testimonials section of your website (https://www.chill6.com/pages/testimonials):
“I’m . . . an all around anxious lady, a Zoloft patient and I’M also prescribed Lorazepam to use as needed. I haven’t touched my latest prescription. That’s how good this is.”
“Our home consists of 3 PTSD cases and high anxiety. Pharmaceuticals made us worse. Chill6 has made a world of difference for all 3 of us.”
“I have been suffering from anxiety for years...this is the ONLY non narcotic I have ever tried that has 100% worked with no side effects.”
Your Chill6 product (all flavors) is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Chill6 product (all flavors) is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, Chill6 (all flavors) fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulteration – Unsafe Food Additive
Even if your Chill6 product, all flavors, was not an unapproved new drug and misbranded drug, it would be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because it contains phenibut HCl, an unsafe food additive under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 348(a)]. If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(C)(i)].
The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. This exception from the food additive definition does not apply here for two reasons: first, Chill6 is not a dietary supplement; second, phenibut HCl is neither a dietary ingredient nor GRAS under the conditions of intended use.
With regard to Chill6, while the product label includes a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement,” your website, www.chill6.com, depicts the product with the statements “vitality drink"" and “anti anxiety drink” and a vignette of the product jars with a filled beverage glass for each Chill6 product flavor, accompanied by slices of fruit which represent the flavors of the products. These statements and vignettes contextually imply that this product is to be used as a beverage—i.e., as a conventional food. Under section 201(ff)(2)(B) of the Act, a dietary supplement is a product that “is not represented for use as a conventional food.” Because you represent Chill6 as a conventional food, it is not a dietary supplement. Therefore, phenibut HCl cannot be a dietary ingredient used in a dietary supplement.
Furthermore, even if Chill6 were a dietary supplement, phenibut HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)] because it is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types. Neither is phenibut HCl GRAS under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement product. Because phenibut HCl does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Chill6 product (all flavors) is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because it contains an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Misbranded Foods
Even if your Chill6 product (all flavors) were not an unapproved new drug and a misbranded drug, it would be a misbranded food under section 403(a)(1) of the Act. The label of your Chill6 product (all flavors) declares the product to be a dietary supplement. However, as explained above, your Chill6 product is represented on your website Chill6.com as a conventional food. Because the definition of dietary supplement states that a dietary supplement is not a product represented as a conventional food, Chill6 is not a dietary supplement [see section 201(ff)(2)(B) of the Act]. Declaring Chill6 to be a dietary supplement is therefore false or misleading and misbrands the product under section 403(a)(1) of the Act. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, or causing thereof, of such misbranded products is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act.

WARNING LETTER
July 22, 2021
RE: 610649
Dear Dr. Melius:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at www.biospectrumcbd.com and www.nasadol.com from April 2021 through July 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for several products, including “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Pain Relief Roll-On,” “CBD Oil Tincture” (500 mg and 1500 mg), “Sour Gummy Worms” (250 mg and 500 mg), “CBD Gummy Worms” (250 mg and 500 mg), “CBD Peach Rings” (250 mg and 500 mg), “Watermelon Slices” (250 mg, 500 mg, and 1000 mg), “CBD Gummy Bears” (500 mg and 1000 mg), “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil,” and “CBD Dog Treats,” all of which are represented as containing cannabidiol (CBD).1We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/BioSpectrumCBD and www.instagram.com/biospectrum.cbd/; these websites direct consumers to your website www.biospectrumcbd.com to purchase your products.
Claims on your websites establish that your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On,” are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product is misbranded in violation of section 502(ee), 21 U.S.C. 352(ee). In addition, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” and “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” are misbranded under 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of a misbranded drug is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
In addition, your “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil,” and “CBD Dog Treats,” are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and are adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
Currently, a nonprescription drug product containing CBD cannot be legally marketed without an approved new drug application, regardless of whether the CBD is represented on the labeling as an active ingredient or an inactive ingredient. To date, no CBD-containing drug has met applicable FDA requirements to be legally marketed for nonprescription use. As explained below, nonprescription drug products that include CBD as an active ingredient are not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) and are new drugs that require an approved application to be legally marketed. Furthermore, even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed, because the product would not meet the general requirements for nonprescription drug products under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, such product would not meet the general requirement with respect to the safety and suitability of inactive ingredients under 21 CFR 330.1(e).
Your “Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” products are intended to be sprayed into the nose and absorbed into the bloodstream. For example, from your website http://nasadol.com/, you state “Our water soluble CBD in the nose is immediately and efficiently absorbed, and directly transferred to within the brain. When you spray Nasadol into your nose, you will start to feel the health effects of our precise dosing right away.” Further, on your website https://www.biospectrumcbd.com/, you state “[T]he product that revolutionized the way CBD is delivered to the brain . . . requires less product for greater relief . . . [w]orks within 30 seconds . . . [i]mproved [b]ioavailability of CBD . . . [b]ypasses blood brain barrier in seconds.” These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because intranasal drug products may be rapidly absorbed through the highly vascularized nasal mucosa directly into systemic blood circulation, where they may exert undesirable systemic effects such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure. If toxic substances are introduced directly into the nose, harmful local effects such as bleeding, ulceration, or nasal septal perforation may occur.
FDA has also determined that your “Sour Gummy Worms,” “CBD Gummy Worms,” “CBD Peach Rings,” “Watermelon Slices,” “CBD Gummy Bears,” “CBD Oil Tincture,” and “CBD Dog Treats” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Sour Gummy Worms,” “CBD Gummy Worms,” “CBD Peach Rings,” “Watermelon Slices,” “CBD Gummy Bears,” “CBD Oil Tincture”, and “CBD Dog Treats” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on a review of your websites, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On,” are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.Examples of claims from your websites www.nasadol.com and www.biospectrumcbd.com that provide evidence of the intended use of these products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From www.nasadol.com• A webpage that features a graphic of Nasadol CBD Nasal Sprays states that “[c]linical trials and other scientific research illustrate CBD’s usefulness in treating pain, anxiety, inflammation, depression, addiction and many other conditions.”
From www.biospectrumcbd.com• “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray”• “Benefitso Supports sense of calm*o For Focus and Anti-Anxiety*o Manage Stress*o Relieves Headaches*o Relieves Sinus Pressure*o Allergy relief*o Maintain and aid healthy sleep cycles*”• “BioSpectrum CBD engineered this Pain Relief Roll-On to provide powerful long lasting relief from aches and pains. By using FDA approved pain relievers; Lidocaine, Menthol, Camphor, along with Broad Spectrum CBD Distillate, this product is truly unique and effective.”
Based on the above labeling claims, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On” products are drugs. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in the published literature that support a determination that any of these products are GRASE for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in their labeling. Thus, “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On” are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are nonprescription drugs governed by and lawfully marketed under section 505G2of the FD&C Act, among other exceptions not applicable here. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” or “Pain Relief Roll-On,” nor do they meet the requirements for marketing without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act, as described below. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
We note that section 505G of the FD&C Act governs nonprescription drugs marketed over-the-counter (or ""OTC"") without an approved drug application, such as your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product.3Under section 505G, certain nonprescription drug products may be lawfully marketed without an approved application if applicable requirements are met. However, your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product does not meet the requirements for marketing under section 505G. Specifically, it does not meet the applicable conditions under section 505G(a)(1) or (2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h(a)(1), (2), under which nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application are deemed GRASE and not considered “new drugs” by operation of law. Among these conditions is that a drug conforms with the general requirements for nonprescription drugs and that it conforms with the requirements for nonprescription use of a final monograph issued under 21 CFR part 330 or, for drugs classified in Category I for safety and effectiveness under a tentative final monograph (TFM), that a drug conforms with the proposed requirements of such TFM. Your “Pain Relief Roll-On” does not meet these conditions, notably because its active ingredient CBD is not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or TFM.4
Although CBD is not explicitly identified as the active ingredient in your “Pain Relief Roll-On,” the product labeling clearly represents CBD as an active ingredient, which is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (see 21 CFR 201.66(b)(2)). For instance, your product label for “Pain Relief Roll-On” prominently highlights on the principal display panel that it contains “1000mg CBD,” the company name on the label is Bio Spectrum CBD, the product is available on your website under the subheading “Shop CBD,” and your product page includes a lab analysis highlighting the product’s CBD content.
We note that you list CBD as an “other ingredient” on your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product label. Drug products only contain “active ingredients” or “inactive ingredients.” To the extent that CBD is intended to be an inactive ingredient in your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product, it would still need an approved drug application to be legally marketed because it does not meet the conditions under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, the product would not meet the conditions under section 505G(a)(1) or (2) insofar that the product does not conform to the general requirement in 21 CFR 330.1(e) that inactive ingredients must be safe and suitable.5A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance).6CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product. Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects7and must be safe when used at the intended dosage.8CBD, however, has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks.9It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your “Pain Relief Roll-On” have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events. Accordingly, CBD cannot be considered a safe and suitable inactive ingredient as required under 21 CFR 330.1(e). Consequently, if CBD is intended to be an inactive ingredient in your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product, this product would not meet the general requirements for nonprescription drugs needed for legal marketing under section 505G(a)(1) of the FD&C Act.
In addition to not meeting section 505G(a)(1) of the FD&C Act, your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product does not meet the other conditions under section 505G under which nonprescription drug products can be lawfully marketed without an approved application. Specifically, it does not satisfy the requirements under sections 505G(a)10nor is its marketing permitted by an order issued under section 505G(b).11In addition, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” and “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” also do not meet the conditions under section 505G for legal marketing without an approved application.12
For the reasons described above, your Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On” are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” and “Pain Relief Roll-On” are misbranded drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and 331(a).
OTC External Analgesic Drug
In particular, your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product is a nonprescription drug subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but does not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section, and is not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. Accordingly, this product is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee).
Nasal Spray Drugs
In addition, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” and “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. See 21 CFR 201.5. The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners, including depression, anxiety, and addiction; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” and “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.13There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your “Sour Gummy Worms,” “CBD Gummy Worms,” “CBD Peach Rings,” “Watermelon Slices,” “CBD Gummy Bears,” and “CBD Oil Tincture” products are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.14
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, “Sour Gummy Worms,” “CBD Gummy Worms,” “CBD Peach Rings,” “Watermelon Slices,” “CBD Gummy Bears,” and “CBD Oil Tincture” are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website, www.biospectrumcbd.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/BioSpectrumCBD and www.instagram.com/biospectrum.cbd/, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil” and “CBD Dog Treats”. Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil” and “CBD Dog Treats” are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your social media websites that establish the intended use of your “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil” and “CBD Dog Treats” as drugs include, but are not limited to, the following:
• On your Facebook and Instagram social media websites at www.facebook.com/BioSpectrumCBD and www.instagram.com/biospectrum.cbd/ respectively, March 22, 2021 postings with a photograph of your “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil” and “CBD Dog Treats” products:o “We have CBD products your pups will be begging for! Did you know CBD may help reduce anxiety, pain and inflammation in dogs? CBD isn’t just for humans anymore!”
Your “1,000mg Canine CBD Oil” and “CBD Dog Treats” products are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. These product are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food, to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
According to your product labeling, your “CBD Dog Treats” product is an animal food to which CBD has been added. Specifically, your product label depicted on your website, www.biospectrumcbd.com, refers to this product as a “Dog Treat” and as “Steak Bites.” Additionally, the product label includes a “Guaranteed Analysis” section, which promotes the product as a source of protein, fat, and fiber. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this product is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.15
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in animal food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the animal food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD in animal food. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal food. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal food are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in animal food. Therefore, CBD added to animal food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348. Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Therefore, your “CBD Dog Treats” is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of this adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

2Section 505G of the FD&C Act was added under title III, subtitle F (""Over-the-Counter Drugs"") of the CARES Act, Pub. L 116-136 (March 27, 2020).
3We note that your “Pain Relief Roll-On” is made available for purchase by consumers without a prescription and that the label for that product includes ostensible ""Drug Facts,"" which is part of the content and format required for OTC drug labeling under 21 CFR 201.66.
4We note that OTC drug products such as your “Pain Relief Roll-On,” intended for external analgesic indications, such as the relief of pain, were addressed in the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983). CBD was not included as an active ingredient under this TFM.
521 CFR 330.1(e) requires that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity"".
6See e.g., ""Using the Inactive Ingredient Database"" Guidance for Industry (July 2019), p. 1 at https://www.fda.gov/media/128687/download, and ""Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients"" Guidance for Industry (May 2005), pp. 1-2 athttps://www.fda.gov/media/72260/download.
7See e.g., 21 CFR 314.3(b) and 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), which define an active ingredient as “any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man.” All other components of a finished drug product are considered inactive ingredients (see CFR 314.3(b), 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8)).
8See 21 CFR 330.1(e).
9For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf.
10Under 505G(a) of the FD&C Act, drugs in a final monograph and drugs that were classified as Category III for safety and effectiveness in a TFM that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination issued under 21 CFR Part 330 -- and that were not classified in such a TFM as Category II for safety or effectiveness -- are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable final monograph or TFM, including labeling conditions, and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs. Drugs containing CBD as an active ingredient were not classified under any final monograph or any TFM as Category III for safety and effectiveness. Thus, your “CBD Containing Products” do not meet the conditions under section 505G(a) for lawful marketing absent an approved application.
11Your “Pain Relief Roll-On” product is not the subject of an order issued under section 505G(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355h(b)(1), under which it is considered GRASE and can be lawfully marketed without an approved application.
12As noted above, CBD, the active ingredient in “Regular Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray” and “Extra Strength Nasadol CBD Nasal Spray,” is not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or TFM. Moreover, the website labeling for these products includes indications such as depression, anxiety, and addiction, which are indications not covered under any applicable final monograph or TFM.
13CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See Sativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer Pain and GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
14Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
15Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5)), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER
May 18, 2021Dear Mr. Mullins:
This letter is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://umbrella.us in November 2020 and again in February 2021 and has observed that this website directs consumers to your additional websites at the Internet addresses https://umbrellalabs.is, https://alphamaleplus.us, https://etanicals.us, and https://supplementor.com, which we also reviewed, and where you take orders for “Alpha Male Plus,” “Red Vein Bali Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa,” “Red Ketapang Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa,” “Tianeptine Sodium Solution,” “NACET Powder Nootropic,” and numerous products marketed as selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs), including but not limited to “GW-501516 Cardarine – 20 MG/ML,” “MK-2866 Ostarine SARM – 20 MG/ML,” “MK-677 Ibutamoren Nutrobal Powder,” “RAD-140 Testolone,” “S-4 Andarine SARM Powder,” and “S-4 Andarine SARM 50 mg/mL.” We also have reviewed your Facebook and Instagram social media websites at the Internet addresses https://www.facebook.com/umbrellasarms and https://www.instagram.com/umbrella_labs_research/, respectively; these social media websites direct consumers to your website https://umbrellalabs.is/ to purchase your products. In addition, FDA has obtained a sample of and labeling for your product, “Alpha Male Plus,” which is also referred to as “Alpha Male+” on your product labeling and on the website http://alphamaleplus.us. As described below, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a) and 301(d)] and misbranded drugs sold in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 352 and 331(a)].
“Alpha Male Plus”
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Alpha Male Plus” contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient tadalafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Tadalafil is the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Cialis, used to treat erectile dysfunction. This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.
FDA has issued a warning to consumers not to use “Alpha Male Plus” (see Alpha Male Plus Immediate Public Notification https://www.fda.gov/drugs/medication-health-fraud/publicnotification-alpha-male-plus-contains-hidden-drug-ingredient).
“Alpha Male Plus,” which you offer for sale on the website https://alphamaleplus.us, is labeled as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)], a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Cialis™ (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003. Given that tadalafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Cialis was approved, “Alpha Male Plus,” which contains tadalafil, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
We also note that your “Alpha Male Plus,” which is labeled as a dietary supplement, bears directions for sublingual administration. However, the term “dietary supplement” is defined in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)] as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Even if your “Alpha Male Plus” were not excluded from the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i), because sublingual products are intended to enter the body directly through the skin or mucosal tissues, your “Alpha Male Plus” is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement for this additional reason.
A list of tainted products marketed as dietary supplements discovered by FDA can be found at http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/sda/sdNavigation.cfm?sd=tainted_supplements_cder
“Alpha Male Plus” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)] because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Examples of claims observed on your product labeling and website that establish the intended use of your product as a drug include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From the product label:
? “Alpha Male Plus is a male enhancement supplement that improves sexual performance as a truly unique natural solution for erectile dysfunction. . . .”
From the website https://alphamaleplus.us:
? “In simple terms, AMP(Alpha Male Plus) is a [sic] all natural, no prescription needed male enhancement supplement that improves sexual performance as well as proven natural solution for erectile dysfunction. . . .

Kratom Products
As previously noted, we have reviewed your website at https://etanicals.us and determined that you take orders there for kratom products, including but not limited to, “Red Vein Bali Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa” and “Red Ketapang Kratom Powder.” Examples of claims observed on your website that establish the intended use of your kratom products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Red Vein Bali Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa”
From the product webpage at https://etanicals.us/shop/kratom/red-ketapang-kratompowder-mitragyna-speciosa/:

Nootropic Products
We have reviewed your website at https://supplementor.com and determined that you take orders there for “Tianeptine Sodium Solution” and “NACET Powder Nootropic.” Examples of claims observed on your website and Instagram social media website that establish the intended use of your “Tianeptine Sodium Solution” and “NACET Nootropic Powder” products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
“Tianeptine Sodium Solution”
From the product webpage at https://supplementor.com/online-store/Tianeptine-Sodium-Solution-50MG-ML-30ML-Bottle-Nootropic-p203879912:? “Tianeptine Sodium Solution is a potent mood brightener and nootropic, celebrated for its effects on wellbeing and cognition, providing immediate and also long term benefits.

? From a March 19, 2020 post – “. . . [W]e have great news in regards to the Corona Virus. Have you checked out our Nacet Powder? If you haven't yet, did you know it will mitigate the symptoms of COVID-19? . . . Given the rapid spread and global pandemic status of COVID-19, health profesionals [sic] are increasingly focusing on disease mitigation rather [sic] than disease containment. With over 2,000 confirmed cases in the US spread across 47 states, your odds of contracting COVID-19 are rapidly rising. The safe bet now is to prepare to deal with infeciton [sic] rather than naively hoping to avoid it. Crucially, a large body of the primary research demonstrates that dietary supplementation with the potent antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) can inhibit RNA virus replication and reduce the severity of associated diseases. NAC is a simple amino acid who [sic] antioxidant power adn [sic] bioavailability can be dramatically improved by simple enzymatic modication [sic] to N-acetylcysteine ethyl ester (NACET). This modification of NAC permits unprecedented protection of your blood cells from oxidative damage, thus enabling your body's immune system to effectively defend your body from ravages of COVID-19 . . .

From your Instagram social media website https://www.instagram.com/p/B90ECHinoy0/:
? From a March 16, 2020 post - “With all the news about Corona Virus (COVID-19), the thoughts and worries are escalating quickly! It's time to take action and do what needs to be done to keep ourselves and our love ones protected! . . .

As noted here, we observed that your website https://supplementor.is offers “NACET Powder Nootropic,” a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.1Furthermore, FDA has warned consumers (https://www.fda.gov/food/dietarysupplement-products-ingredients/tianeptine-dietary-supplements) about products containing tianeptine, which is used as a prescription drug in some European, Asian, and Latin American countries, but is not approved as a drug in the United States. The FDA is aware of several serious adverse event reports associated with tianeptine. Further, consumers may find themselves addicted to tianeptine.
Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs)
We have reviewed your website at https://umbrellalabs.is and determined that you take orders there for numerous products marketed as SARMS including, but not limited to, “GW-501516 Cardarine – 20 MG/ML,” “MK-2866 Ostarine SARM – 20 MG/ML,” “MK-677 Ibutamoren Nutrobal Powder,” “RAD-140 Testolone,” “S-4 Andarine SARM Powder” and “S-4 Andarine SARM 50 mg/mL” (hereinafter collectively referred to as SARMs products).
FDA has safety concerns about products that contain SARMs (Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators). Life-threatening reactions, including liver toxicity, have occurred in people taking products containing SARMs. SARMs also have the potential to increase the risk of heart attack and stroke. Despite statements on your website and product labels marketing your SARMs products for “RESEARCH USE ONLY” and “Not for Human Consumption,” evidence obtained from your website and social media websites establish that your products are intended to be drugs for human use. Examples of claims observed on your website that establish the intended use of your SARMs products as drugs intended for human use include, but may not be limited to, the following:
From the website https://umbrellalabs.is/best-place-to-buy-sarms-in-2021/: December 24, 2020 blog page titled “BEST PLACE TO BUY SARMS IN 2021”:
? “There are many reasons why you may be considering adding Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators (SARMs) to your health and well routine. As we get older, the natural aging process can catalyze many changes to our psychological processes. You might notice that your muscles aren’t as solid as they used to be, and your bones are feeling frailer. You may also find that your energy levels have dipped. Many of these concerns and challenges are linked back to a decline in testosterone levels, which can affect both men and women. The best SARMs on the market work to replenish those levels, helping you build stronger bones and muscles over time.”
? “SARMS VS ANABOLIC STEROIDS[,] SARMs are unique compounds widely used as a form of testosterone therapy and replacement. . . . Unlike steroids, SARMs only activate the androgen receptors in your bone and muscle tissues, rather than generating a full-body response. This helps to protect the tissues in your prostate and cardiovascular system. As SARMs do not contain the same molecular ring structure as steroids, they are not classified as such. . . . As such, it’s specially positioned to address a range of health conditions, including breast cancer. The premise behind this mechanism is simple: Targeted tissues will respond to SARMs in a similar way as they would to testosterone or another anabolic steroid. However, other tissues that my produce undesirable side effects if targeted are not triggered. This allows you to receive many of the same benefits as conventional testosterone therapy, without incurring many of the associated risks.”
? “UNIQUE BENEFITS FOR WOMEN[,] Women who suffer from low testosterone might find that steroid therapies leave them feeling unfeminine, with a deeper voice than they’re [sic] normal. This is one of the unique benefits of SARMs. These supplements are tissue-specific, focusing on your bones along with your muscles. This means they only raise testosterone levels there, rather than amplifying them throughout your body. This is excellent news for women, who are more likely than men to develop osteoporosis as they age. . . . By undergoing SARMs therapy, women and men alike can take a targeted approach to strengthening their bones and muscles together.”
? “WHERE CAN I FIND THE BEST SARMS?[,] . . . Before you begin your quest, take the time to consider why you’re looking to buy SARMs in the first place. Which particular ailments are you looking to address? Will these SARMS be for your personal use or are you looking to help a loved one who has tried traditional therapies in the past to no avail? Once you know the answers to these questions, you can begin to look for the specific kinds of SARMs you need to address your particular pain points. In our online store, we offer a variety of SARM compounds in liquid and powder form . . . You can learn more about each product and discover more by browsing our online shop.” The words “online shop” are hyperlinked and direct consumers to the product page on your website https://umbrellalabs.is/online-store/SARMs-c33887656 where your SARMs products are available for purchase.
From the website https://umbrellalabs.is/a-practical-guide-to-sublingual-absorption/: September 21, 2020 blog page titled “A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO SUBLINGUAL ABSORPTION”:
? “The goal of sublingual absorption is to get substances (i.e. SARMs) into systemic circulation and delivered to target organs (i.e. muscles and bones) without first passing through the liver. . . . Every substance this absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract passes through the liver before it gets distributed throughout the body. To bypass this “first-pass effect”, follow these steps:o Step 1. Using the dropper, measure your Poly-Cell Formula and deposit it under your tongue.o Step 2. Leave it under your tongue for 1-2 minutes without swallowing. Keep your head tilted slightly back to prevent saliva from pooling in your mouth.o Step 3. After 1-2 minutes, you can swallow to clear out your mouth, but avoid drinking anything for at least 10 minutes in order to swallow any residual Poly-Cell Formula to fully absorb in your mouth, throat and upper esophagus. . . .
Poly-Cell Formula Productso GW 501516 CARDARINEo RAD-140 TESTOLONE SARM. . .”
Your Facebook and Instagram pages also contain evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of SARM products for use in affecting the structure or function of the body of humans. Examples of such testimonials, which are endorsed or promoted by Umbrella Labs, include:
From your Facebook social media website https://www.facebook.com/umbrellasarms:
? From an October 7, 2020 post - Umbrella Labs “liked” the following comment made on your post advertising “RAD-140 Testolone”: “Rad 140 works for me, my muscles became firm and larger at around the 4th -6th week”? From an August 19, 2020 post - Umbrella Labs “liked” the following comments made in response to your post advertising your various SARM products:o “I bought mk677 and rad 140. You need to see my transformation in less than 30 days . . .”o “Was on . . . rad140, . . . 1 andro, ostarine. Gained 13 lbs in 6 weeks. Looking to put that muscle on again . . .”

Unapproved New Drugs
Your “Alpha Male Plus,” “Red Vein Bali Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa,” “Red Ketapang Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa,” “Tianeptine Sodium Solution,” “NACET Powder Nootropic,” and SARMs products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. As previously stated, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. No approved applications pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 355] are in effect for these products. Accordingly, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products violates sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)].
Misbranded Drugs
In addition, your “Alpha Male Plus,” “Red Vein Bali Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa” “Red Ketapang Kratom Powder Mitragyna Speciosa,” “NACET Powder Nootropic,” “GW-501516 Cardarine – 20MG/ML,” “MK-2866 Ostarine SARM – 20MG/ML,” “MK-677 Ibutamoren Nutrobal Powder,” “RAD-140 Testolone,” “S-4 Andarine SARM Powder,”and “S-4 Andarine SARM 50 mg/mL” products are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)], in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5) The aforementioned products are prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)] because they are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them.
Additionally, under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(a)], a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(n)], provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for “Alpha Male Plus” does not declare that it contains tadalafil. The failure to disclose the presence of tadalafil in the product’s labeling renders “Alpha Male Plus” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors contained in your product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take this product without knowing that it can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. Those consumers who have been advised against taking PDE-5 inhibitors because of comorbidities or potential drug interactions may seek products like “Alpha Male Plus” because it is not labeled as containing PDE-5 inhibitors.
The undeclared tadalafil in “Alpha Male Plus” also causes this product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)] in that the product’s labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use “Alpha Male Plus” would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredient and placed at risk for its associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Conclusion
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.

Dear Dr. Farrah Agustin-Bunch:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses doctorfarrah.com and drfarrah.online in February and March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Boston C, Mega-Dose Vitamin C, and Pixie Dust Magnesium. We have also reviewed your Instagram social media website at instagram.com/drfarrahmd/, which directs consumers to your website doctorfarrah.com to purchase your products. The claims on your websites establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your webpage “The Science Of Boston C” (https://doctorfarrah.com/2019/07/01/the-scienceof-boston-c/):
Claims about Boston C: “Boston C was the cornerstone of the treatment protocols at my facility in the Philippines where I treated 150,000 patients for all manner of illnesses over the course of 16 years.” “…Boston C was demonstrated to be highly effective against numerous cancer cell lines….” “…Boston C was tested at St. Luke’s Medical Center and declared by St. Luke’s personnel to be effective against cancer….” “My opinion is that the vast number of degenerative illnesses that we see have a significant nutritional causative component. Further, I believe that when these nutritional issues are properly and consistently addressed through the use of a product such as Boston C, that a patient has the opportunity to return to health….”
Claims about ingredients in Boston C (e.g., vitamins, selenium, methyl-sulfonyl-methane (MSM), blackstrap molasses, and micronutrients generally): “Recent evidence has shown that suboptimal levels of vitamins, even well above those causing deficiency syndromes, are risk factors for chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and osteoporosis…” “Numerous studies have reported that higher micronutrient consumption results in a significantly lower cancer risk” “‘…our findings strongly suggest that at high intakes, these micronutrients exhibit independent associations in both whites and African Americans consistent with 30–70% reductions in colon cancer risk.’” “The available clinical data suggest that micronutrient supplementation can reduce the risk and severity of infection and support a faster recovery….” “Micronutrients effectively control multiple steps in breast cancer.” “In relation to micronutrient mixtures, a ‘synergistic micronutrient mixture has been shown to be effective against multiple targets in cancer development and progression.’” “In relation to Selenium, (which Boston C contains) the major effects of supplementation have been observed in the incidences of colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers along with a drastic decrease in the total cancer mortality by 50%. Study results have … provided evidence that taking a multivitamin/mineral preparation can improve … the prognosis of patients with cancer. For example, a study carried out at the Mayo Clinic (USA) of 1129 patients with lung cancer showed that mortality was reduced by 26% in patients taking a micronutrient preparation compared with those not taking any such supplements.”1 “It’s been demonstrated that MSM is … anti-inflammatory, … immunomodulative, and anti-cancer.” “MSM has been shown to improve inflammation in a number of conditions. For example, MSM attenuated cytokine expression in vivo for induced colitis, lung injury, and liver injury. MSM has been shown to help with liver injury due to acetaminophen. ‘Our findings suggest that MSM pretreatment could alleviate hepatic injury induced by acetaminophen intoxication….’” “In a physician’s review of clinical case studies, MSM was an effective treatment for four out of six patients suffering from interstitial cystitis. Additionally, MSM is also suggested to alleviate the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis.” “An emerging area of MSM research deals with the anti-cancer effect of the organosulfur compound.” “MSM independently has been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells by inhibiting cell viability through the induction of cell cycle arrest, necrosis, or apoptosis.” “Methylsulfonylmethane (organic sulfur) induces apoptosis and decreases invasiveness of prostate cancer cells.” “‘Based on all these results from our study, we strongly recommend the use of MSM as a trial drug for treating breast cancers because of its multi-targeting mechanism.’ ‘In conclusion, our results show for the first time that MSM induces apoptosis in HCT-116 colon cancer cells regardless of their p53 status.’ ‘Taken together, all the results suggest that MSM has anti-cancer effects through inducing apoptosis in liver cancer.’” “In studies with osteoarthritic populations given MSM daily, significant improvements in physical function were observed.…” “‘Our results support previous anecdotal reports that intervention with MSM on elderly patients suffering from OA [osteoarthritis] is beneficial….’” “Patients with OA of the knee taking MSM for 12 weeks showed an improvement in pain and physical function.” “Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), the isoxidised form of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DSMO), is an effective natural analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent. MSM has been shown to effect inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.” “‘Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) … is expected to relieve inflammation in arthritis and allergies…Intake of MSM for 13 weeks decreased degeneration of the cartilage at the joint surface in the knee joints…’” “We chose this method of using a nutrient dense natural sugar as a carrier due to cancer cells being sugar metabolic….” “In theory, sugar-loving cancer cells are tricked into taking in everything else in Boston C when they gobble up the molasses. ‘Recent data on cane molasses appear to lend support to historical accounts concerning its effectiveness as both preventative and a possible curative agent for some cancer.’” “Blackstrap molasses is rich in a variety of essential minerals including iron, zinc, selenium, magnesium and potassium as well as the majority of the vitamin B complex, deficiencies of which confer a major cancer risk. Molasses also contains high concentrations of amino acids and linoleic acid, an essential lipid that has a documented anti-tumor effect.”
On your webpage “The science supporting Mega-dose Vitamin C” (https://doctorfarrah.com/2020/12/30/the-science-supporting-mega-dose-vitamin-c/): “Shown to help prevent colds & flu…” “…good for immunodeficiency, chronic toxin or infectious problems” “Good for histamine intolerance” “High dose vitamin C has anti-cancer effects” “Vitamin C May Combat Cancer & Ease Cancer Treatment” “Numerous reports suggest that high-dose Vitamin C has anticancer effects. High-dose Vitamin C is reportedly more toxic to cancer than it is to normal cells and induces death of various types of cancer cells including mesothelioma, pancreatic, and leukemia cells.” “High dietary Vitamin C has been reported to reduce gastric cancer risk.” “Higher dietary Vitamin C intake before breast cancer diagnosis increased the chances of survival.” “Men with low Vitamin C levels have been reported to have a 62% higher risk of dying from cancer. Vitamin C has been shown to lower pain and reduce the toxicity of some anticancer agents by reducing oxidative stress. Vitamin C has been reported to alleviate a number of cancer and chemotherapy-related symptoms, such as fatigue, insomnia, loss of appetite, nausea, and pain. Vitamin C is reported to improve the quality of life for cancer patients, including reduced pain and the need for painkillers, both in the presence and absence of chemo- and radiotherapy.” “Many infections were reported to lead to reduced Vitamin C levels. Vitamin C allegedly increases the functioning of various white blood cell types and decreases the replication of viruses. Vitamin C reportedly reduces the duration and severity of the common cold.” “Vitamin C potentially reduces the incidence of pneumonia. Vitamin C reportedly decreased the duration and severity of respiratory infections in male swimmers. Vitamin C reportedly eradicates H. pylori infection in 30% of patients treated, which is a precursor for ulcers. Vitamin C Has Been Reported To Help Reduce Inflammation. Vitamin C reportedly reduces inflammation by lowering inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin C can reportedly alleviate inflammation in patients with obesity, diabetes or high blood pressure.” “Vitamin C was shown to improve gut tolerability to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in this study (NSAIDs).” “Vitamin C also supposedly prevents neuronal damage.” “Many studies have found that Vitamin C can reduce the severity of depressive disorders in both children and adults….” “In a trial including depressed shift workers, Vitamin C significantly decreased depression severity.” “Poor Vitamin C status is associated with increased symptoms of depression following an acute illness in older people.” “Vitamin C has been shown to increases [sic] the effectiveness of antidepressants. Patients treated for six months with fluoxetine and Vitamin C showed a significant decrease in depressive symptoms compared to the fluoxetine plus placebo group according to studies.” “Chronic low Vitamin C status in humans is allegedly associated with neurodegenerative disorders.” “Vitamin C levels were significantly lower in elderly people suffering from different kinds of dementia as per this study.” “Supplementation with Vitamin C reduces the risk of Alzheimer’s disease in humans according to this study.” “Vitamin C May Improve Blood Pressure. Vitamin C significantly lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure in patients with mild-to-moderately high blood pressure according to the authors of this study.” “According to some studies, high-dose Vitamin C can prevent or restore impaired blood flow caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), preserve the integrity of the blood vessel barrier, and strengthen antibacterial defenses.” “Vitamin C plays a positive role in reversing the earliest stages of hardening of the arteries. Vitamin C deficiency may result in decreased blood vessel integrity, e.g. through decreased NOS generation and impaired synthesis of mature collagen. This might lead to increased plaque formation and incidence of stroke.” “This study further demonstrated that Vitamin C has been associated with a lower prevalence of obesity….” “Vitamin C is Beneficial for Diabetics” “Vitamin C protects against diabetic blindness…. Vitamin C may benefit patients with type 2 diabetes by decreasing blood glucose and lipids.” “Higher Vitamin C intakes were associated with a lower risk of osteoporosis in Korean adults aged over 50 with low levels of physical activity.” “Vitamin C May Protect from Stroke” “In humans, higher Vitamin C levels are associated with a lower likelihood of stroke.” “Post-operative atrial fibrillation (abnormal heart rhythm) was prevented after cardiac surgery by vitamin C supplementation.” “Regarding AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome), ‘Ascorbate does ameliorate the AID syndrome to a significant degree. I want to emphasize, however, the absolute necessity of massive doses.’” “Patients receiving kidney dialysis are prone to deficiency of Vitamin C. Schizophrenic patients tend to have significantly lower levels of blood Vitamin C.”
On your webpage “The Science supporting Pixie Dust Magnesium” (https://doctorfarrah.com/2019/07/01/the-science-supporting-pixie-dust-magnesium/): “‘Doctors eagerly prescribe expensive patented drugs, while low-cost nutrients like magnesium remain overlooked. If the 68% of Americans who are magnesium deficient took corrective action, the need for many of these prescription drugs would be reduced.’” “Magnesium deficiency in Western societies has been linked to insulin resistance, type II diabetes, metabolic syndrome, coronary heart disease, colorectal cancer, and colorectal adenoma. ‘Low Magnesium intakes and blood levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, elevated C-reactive protein, hypertension, atherosclerotic vascular disease, sudden cardiac death, osteoporosis, migraine headache, asthma, and colon cancer.’” “‘Although the evidence is still fragmentary, most of the data available point to Magnesium as a chemopreventive agent…’ In a study with 1,200 lung cancer patients and a similar number of controls, low dietary Magnesium intake was associated with reduced lung cancer risk.” “‘Our findings support the hypothesis that higher intakes of dietary Magnesium are associated with lower risk of colorectal tumors.’” “‘...it seems that Mg has a cytotoxic effect against breast cancer cells…Mg can be considered as a supplement agent in the treatment of breast cancer patients….’” “‘Our finding indicates that higher blood Magnesium levels are associated with a lower risk of high-grade prostate cancer.’” “‘Magnesium was found to be lower in patients with leukemia in this study” “Low Magnesium intake is linked to chronic inflammation, which is one of the drivers of cancer, … obesity and chronic disease.” “Magnesium benefits people with type 2 diabetes.” “Increasing Magnesium intake appears to reduce blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. A meta-analysis ofeight studiesshowed that taking a Magnesium supplement significantly reduced fasting blood sugar levels in participants with type 2 diabetes.” “Magnesium may reduce the risk of Heart Disease. Numerous studies have linked suboptimal Magnesium levels to a higher risk of heart disease.” “Magnesium has strong anti-inflammatory properties, may prevent blood clotting and can help your blood vessels relax to lower your blood pressure.” “‘There is growing evidence that Magnesium may have a role in managing asthma through its dual effect as an anti-inflammatory and bronchodilating agent.’” “Magnesium deficiency has a role in many diseases in addition to asthma, including migraines, depression, and epilepsy.” “Magnesium can help fight migraines. Many researchers believe that people who suffer from migraines are more likely than others to be deficient with Magnesium.” “Studies are now suggesting that Magnesium can prevent and even help treat migraines….” “Magnesium may help reduce the symptoms of depression.” “Several studies have shown that supplementing with Magnesium may reduce symptoms of depression. Some studies even found it to be as effective as antidepressant drugs.” “[T]hose supplementing with oral Magnesium daily … noted … decreased symptoms of insomnia.”
Your Boston C, Mega-Dose Vitamin C, and Pixie Dust Magnesium products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Boston C, Mega-Dose Vitamin C, and Pixie Dust Magnesium are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Boston C, Mega-Dose Vitamin C, and Pixie Dust Magnesium fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: 605871
Dear Mr. Amin,
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.store.eunatural.com, in March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” and “CONCEPTION MEN Male Fertility”. We have also reviewed your social media website at www.instagram.com/eunatural/; this website directs consumers to your website www.store.eunatural.com to purchase your products. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in May 2021.
The claims on your website establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
On your webpage titled “10 Best Natural Fertility Herbs and Boosters for Women”:• “Myo-Insitol [sic] [an ingredient in “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal”] . . . When taken as a supplement, it can absolutely combat infertility issues. One study looked at 25 women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. They were given myo-insitol [sic] (combined with folic acid) two times a day for 6 months. 88% ended up having ‘at least one spontaneous menstrual cycle’ during this treatment. Of that 88%, 72% maintained normal ovulatory activity. Plus, 10 of the 25 women actually got pregnant while on myo- insitol [sic]. Another study that looked specifically at women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome found myo-insitol [sic] improves ovarian cells and embryo quality when the woman is in the ovarian stimulation process.”• “[W]hen you add in the vitamin D [an ingredient in “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal”] you not only improve polycystic ovary syndrome, you also can improve the income [sic] on in-vitro fertilization.”
On your webpage titled “4 Beneficial Ways To Treat Endometriosis Naturally”:• Top choices for those with endometriosis include…B6…Chaste Tree [both ingredients in “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal”]… If you are currently dealing with infertility as a result of endometriosis, try to find prenatal vitamins/supplements that include some of these natural remedies.”
On your webpage titled “Ashwagandha: Benefits, side effects and how to take it?” [ashwagandha is an ingredient in “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” and “CONCEPTION MEN Male Fertility”]:• “…[B]enefits that Ashwagandha is believed to have…include: …Helping with depression, Treating arthritis…Reducing blood sugar levels, Stopping cancer growth, Helping with insomnia”• “Ashwagandha is also commonly linked to being a natural way to help overcome anxiety… taking Ashwagandha extract can be hugely beneficial for those living with anxiety.”• “Ashwagandha has been linked to increasing insulin secretion and improving insulin sensitivity in muscle cells and could help treat diabetes.”• “Ashwagandha extract had [sic] antidiabetic properties, including decreased blood glucose level, preventing hyperinsulinemia, and improved glucose tolerance.”• “…Ashwagandha demonstrates anti-cancer effects against several cancer cell lines.”• “…[A]shwagandha selectively kills tumor cells.”• “…natural source for safe anticancer medicine.”• “…Ashwagandha is also said to help with insomnia.”
Your social media website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include the following:
Claim featured on Instagram (www.instagram.com/eunatural/):• “Why did I start taking Conception from @eunatural you may ask... I possibly have PCOS and Myo Inositol [an ingredient in “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal”] has been shown to help regulate Insulin and regulate your cycle. I’m excited to add this into my #fertilityjourney”
Your products “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” and CONCEPTION MEN Male Fertility” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. § 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” and “CONCEPTION MEN Male Fertility” products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self- diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your “CONCEPTION Female Fertility Prenatal” and “CONCEPTION MEN Male Fertility” products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

If you have any questions, you may also contact Aaron Dotson at aaron.dotson@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has determined that it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.POM Wonderful LLC, 155 F.T.C. 1, 60-61, (2013),aff’d in relevant part, 777 F.3d 478 (D.C.

More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. SeeDaniel Chapter One, WL 5160000 at *17-19.
The FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited above may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. The FTC strongly urges you to review all claims for your products and ensure that those claims are supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or Administrative Cease and Desist Order. In addition, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of a disease may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation pursuant to Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b).

Dear Wolfe Vaughn and Craig Sheralyn:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.naturacure.net in March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the product “NaturaCure.” You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your website in May 2021.

Dear Mr. Hind Tatni,
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.fertilherb.com, in March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the product “FertilHerb for Women”. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your website in May 2021.

Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:

Article titled “Vitex and fertility in women”:• “Doctors use Vitex [an ingredient in “FertilHerb for Women”] to treat mild endometriosis or prevent its advancement. It has also been effective in treating amenorrhea, which is the lack of menstruation, as well as irregular menstruation, which can hinder fertility greatly.”
Article titled “Fertility Supplement Myo-inositol aka Inositol”:• “A case study was carried out where German gynecologists evaluated 3602 women who were suffering from Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. They took Myo-inositol and folic acid [ingredients in “FertilHerb for Women”] every morning for 2-3 months... 2520 women restored to normal cycles while 545 of them got pregnant.”

WARNING LETTER
May 20, 2021
RE: 605595
Dear Mr. Norbert Gleicher,
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses, www.fertilitynutraceuticals.com and www.fertilitysupplementstore.com in March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products “CONFLAM- Forte™,” “FERTINATAL® DHEA”, and “OVOENERGEN™ CoenzymeQ10”. You are also advised that the Federal Trade Commission reviewed your websites in May 2021.
The claims on your websites and literature included with a sale of “CONFLAM-Forte™” establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
On the website www.fertilitynutraceuticals.com:
On the Fertility Supplements Page:• “[B]est fertility supplements to boost your chance of pregnancy or improve your IVF success rate…include… FERTINATAL® Women’s DHEA 25 mg… “OVOENERGEN™ Women’s CoQ10 333mg….”
On the News Tab:• “[O]ne of the best defenses against miscarriage is to make sure your body is ready for conception and pregnancy at the cellular level. Our supplements are designed to do just that. A 2007 study demonstrated that DHEA decreases the miscarriage rate of women”
Article titled: “4 Important Fertility Questions Answered”:• “Fertinatal Fertility DHEA has been show in multiple studies to . . . reduce miscarriage risk.”
On the website www.fertilitysupplementstore.com:
On the “Supplement Guide” page:• “FERTINATAL® DHEA For Women is recommended for:… Women . . . receiving fertility treatment...”• “CONFLAM-Forte™ . . . is recommended for: Women with evidence of inflammation. . . Women with inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases . . . Women with severe allergies . . . Women with PCOS and with obesity…”• “OVOENERGEN ™ CoenzymeQ10 . . . is recommended for: Women who aretrying to get pregnant either on their own, or with fertility treatments . . .”• “Egg Health Power Pack I [which combines FERTINATAL® DHEA with OVOENERGEN ™ CoenzymeQ10] is recommended for:… Women who have low ovarian reserve . . . Women . . . with high miscarriage risk”
On the “CONFLAM-Forte™” page:• “…Fertility Doctors Recommend Conflam-Forte . . . Alleviatesoveractive inflammation”• “CONFLAM-Forte™ . . . is especially recommended for: Women with evidence of inflammation . . . Women with inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases. . . Women with severe allergies…Women with PCOS and with obesity…”
The literature that you enclose, shipped with a sale of the “CONFLAM-Forte™” product, contains evidence that your product is intended for use as drug, including the following:
“CONFLAM Forte™” product insert:• “POTENTIAL BENEFITS: Studies have suggested that calming the immune system by modulating inflammation can enhance female fertility, improve pregnancy chances with. . . IVF, and lower miscarriage risks”• “[W]ell suited for women with infertility, a history of implantation failure, chemical pregnancies and miscarriages or with known inflammatory conditions, like obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), severe allergies and autoimmune conditions.”
“CONFLAM-Forte™” product label:• “[C]omprehensive Inflammation-Modulating Nutritional Supplement for Fertility”• “Since excessive inflammation is very frequent, CONFLAM-Forte™ . . . is especially recommended for . . . women with evidence of inflammation . . . women with inflammatory diseases including autoimmune diseases . . . women with severe allergies, PCOS and obesity.”
Your products “CONFLAM Forte™”, “FERTINATAL® DHEA”, and “OVOENERGEN™ CoenzymeQ10” are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. § 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “CONFLAM Forte™” product is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, your “CONFLAM Forte™” product fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, this product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

If you have any questions, you may also contact Aaron Dotson at aaron.dotson@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has determined that it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess a reasonable basis consisting of competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.POM Wonderful LLC, 155 F.T.C. 1, 60-61, (2013),aff’din relevant part, 777 F.3d 478 (D.C.

More generally, to make or exaggerate such claims, whether directly or indirectly, through the use of a product name, website name, metatags, or other means, without rigorous scientific evidence sufficient to substantiate the claims, violates the FTC Act. See Daniel Chapter One, WL 5160000 at *17-19.
The FTC is concerned that one or more of the efficacy claims cited above may not be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence. The FTC strongly urges you to review all claims for your products and ensure that those claims are supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction or Administrative Cease and Desist Order. In addition, marketers who make deceptive claims about the treatment, cure, prevention, or mitigation of a disease may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $43,792 per violation pursuant to Section 5(m)(1)(B) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 45(m)(1)(B), and may be required to pay refunds to consumers or provide other relief pursuant to Section 19(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 57b(b).

Dear Mr. D’Amelio:
This letter concerns your product Coral Calcium, which is labeled as a dietary supplement. Your product labeling declares cesium chloride as a dietary ingredient in Coral Calcium.
The term “dietary supplement” is defined in section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. Cesium chloride is a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)]. Further, as a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, cesium chloride is a “new dietary ingredient” under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that cesium chloride was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, cesium chloride is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that cesium chloride will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing cesium chloride would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In fact, animal research has shown that taking cesium chloride can cause irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. Furthermore, there have been reports of humans experiencing serious heart problems after taking cesium chloride. Cesium chloride is associated with a lower blood level of potassium, which is a mineral that is essential to normal heart function. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing cesium chloride are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.

Dear Mr. Mehta:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.unived.us/ in February and March 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Unived brand Colox, CalDveg, B12+D3, and D3+K2-7. We have also reviewed your Amazon.com product pages for Unived, Inc. for the Unived brand CalDveg and B12+D3 products. The claims on your website and Amazon.com product pages establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.

Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Unived brand CalDveg, B12+D3, and D3+K2-7 are intended for the treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Unived brand CalDveg,B12+D3, and D3+K2-7 fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

Dear Mr. Denizard-Flores:
This is to advise you that in March 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://www.biogreencell.com from which you take orders for the product Immune Bio Green Cell. We also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/BioGreenCell/, which directs consumers to your website, https://www.biogreencell.com, to purchase your product.
The claims on your website establish that Immune Bio Green Cell is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (the Act), [21 U.S.C 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for the use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's homepage atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
On your webpage www.biogreencell.com:• “Immune Bio Green Cell . . . . By modulating your immune system . . . it would have the ability to fight and could help your immune system attack malignant cells while preventing your immune system from attacking and / or destroying good cells.”
• “Pathology: AutismImmune Bio Green Cell may help due to its composition promoting the restoration of the neuronal synapse.”
• “Pathology: Asperger [sic]Immune Bio Green Cell may help due to its composition promoting the restoration of the neuronal synapse.”
• “Pathology: Diabetes Type 2The active principle of Immune Bio Green Cell, is to activate the regeneration of the pancreatic cells so that these can produce sufficient insulin; hence, regulating blood levels.”
• “Integrative with Chemotherapy and RadiotherapyImmune Bio Green Cell could relieve and reduce side effects by strengthening your immune system.”
• “Pathology: Crohn [sic]Immune Bio Green Cell could help you to have your immune system stopped [sic] attacking your own cells, thereby helping to deflate the parts of the gastrointestinal tract, thus returning cellular genetic recognition to your immune system.”
• “Pathologies: Renal, Liver and SpleenImmune Bio Green Cell is an immunomodulator that could return cellular genetic recognition to your immune system to act as a defensive mechanism on malignant cells.”
On your Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/BioGreenCell/:• Posted on February 20, 2018: “Some of the highly complex conditions that may benefit from its [Immune Bio Green Cell’s] use are:o Cancer – All kindso Lupuso Leukemiao HIV and AIDSo Tumorso Rheumatoid arthritiso Epidermolysis Bullosao Psoriasiso Pulmonary hypertensiono Multiple sclerosis”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Immune Bio Green Cell for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
On your webpage www.biogreencell.com:• “I was diagnosed with a progressive condition in my immune system . . . I never imagined the power and the reach so great that Immune Bio Green Cell could have. My tumor markers were reduced almost miraculously.”
• “Its [Immune Bio Green Cell’s] ability to potentially help the immune system exercise its functions optimally, makes it the ideal choice for use as a preventive or as an adjunct treatment for chronic diseases . . .”
Your Immune Bio Green Cell product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Immune Bio Green Cell product is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, the product fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, we offer the following comment:
• On your About Us webpage at https://www.biogreencell.com/aboutus.asp you state that “Immune Bio Green Cell is a product approved as Immune System Enhancement Formula by USDA and is made in a laboratory registered with the FDA.” The About section of your Facebook page for Immune Bio Green Cell at https://www.facebook.com/BioGreenCell/ states “Approved for sale by the ‘USDA’. Manufactured and packaged in laboratory approved by the ‘FDA’ in the United States”. We note that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) does not approve drugs or dietary supplements. We do not have any records that your facility is registered with FDA. Your Immune Bio Green Cell product appears to be labeled as a dietary supplement. Under section 201(ff) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)), a dietary supplement and a component of a dietary supplement are “foods.” Section 415 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 350d) requires domestic and foreign facilities that manufacture, process, pack, or hold food for human or animal consumption in the United States to register with FDA unless the facility qualifies for an exemption from registration (21 CFR 1.226).
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your reply should be directed to Mr. Ramon Hernandez, Acting District Director, Food and Drug Administration, 466 Fernández Juncos Avenue, San Juan, Puerto Rico 00901-3223.

Dear Dr. Giunta:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.propernutrition.com in April 2021 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Colostrum 70/40, Intestive, Seacure (blister pack and bottle), and SeaVive for Immune Support. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)], because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your website https://www.propernutrition.com that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Colostrum 70/40:https://shop.propernutrition.com/products/colostrum-70/40-90-capsule-bottle/
“. . . Colostrum 70/40® is a bovine colostrum that provides Growth Factors and Immune Factors, which are essential for . . . wound or tissue repair.”
Intestive:https://shop.propernutrition.com/products/intestive-120-capsules-blisters-pack/

Seacure:https://shop.propernutrition.com/products/seacure-180-capsules-blister-pack/https://shop.propernutrition.com/products/seacure-180-capsules-bottle/
“. . . health care practitioners report how pleased they are with Seacure®. Through their own clinical experience, they know that the bioactive peptides work directly in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce symptoms and restore gut integrity in patients with Crohn’s, IBS, malabsorption and other gut related problems.”
“. . . proven to be very beneficial in wound healing . . ..”
“. . . beneficial in treating digestive problems and wound healing and for conditions that cause a general malaise, such as AIDS, or treatments like chemotherapy.”
“. . . trigger a sequence of events that . . . reduce inflammation.”

“. . . natural contents provide essential immunoglobulin and other powerful immune factors to kill, block and inhibit the daily threat from viruses and harmful bacteria, particularly in the digestive tract and lungs.”
“. . . supplies immune factors to the intestinal lining to ward off infection . . .”
On “The Science” page, under “Relief for Digestive Disorders”:https://www.propernutrition.com/the-science/relief-for-digestive-disorders/
“Proper Nutrition’s dietary supplements bring relief to patients suffering from a range of digestive disorders, including:
o Irritable Bowel Syndrome – Also known as IBS, this intestinal disorder occurs in the colon and small intestine . . .o Colitis – A chronic illness in which the lining of the colon becomes inflamed and develops ulcers.o Leaky Gut Syndrome – This condition is . . . often associated with diseases such as Crohn’s or Celiac. It occurs when the junctions between your intestines malfunction and allow unwanted – and potentially toxic – material into your blood steam [sic].The bioactive peptides found in products such as Seacure® and Seavive® work directly in your gastrointestinal tract to reduce the symptoms of digestive disorders …. These peptides have also shown to be beneficial in wound healing”On “The Science” page, under “Overview”:https://www.propernutrition.com/the-science/overview/
“SeaVive helps correct pathogenic bowel permeability and prevents hazards from passing through the gut membrane to infect internal organs.”
“Boswellia [an ingredient in Intestive] is a plant used for centuries … as an anti-inflammatory and anti-irritant.”
“Colostrum 70/40® contains valuable immune factors that form antibodies to protect against infection. It also provides grown and immune factors, which are essential for … repairing wounds and tissue injuries.”
Your Colostrum 70/40, Intestive, Seacure (blister pack and bottle), and SeaVive for Immune Support supplement products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Seacure (blister pack and bottle) and SeaVive for Immune Support supplement products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Seacure (blister pack and bottle) and SeaVive supplement products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)].

This is to advise you that from October to December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://www.duocthaotrexanh.com and has determined that you take orders there for the products Immune Health, Ganoderma Lucidum Red Reishi Mushroom, Papaya Leaf Extract and Fucoidan. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201 (g)(1)(B) of the Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (the Act), [21 U.S.C 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for the use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's homepage at www.fda.gov.
New and Misbranded Drugs
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On your website www.duocthaotrexanh.com :Ganoderma Lucidum, Red Reishi Mushroom product:
“THE WONDER MUSHROOM THAT CURES MANY DISEASES AT ONCE”
“Over 2,000 years of study, Lucid Ganoderma as a dietary supplement, is proven to be effective in treating many diseases including: High blood pressure…Diabetes…Asthma…Hypertension…Alzeiheimer’s [sic] disease…Chronic fatigue syndromes…Insomnia…Leukemia (Increase white blood cell)…Hepatitis A, B, C…Cancer treatment…Fight HIV infection..Depress [sic], Neurosis diseases…Anti-tumor…”

“[A]nti-cancer/anti-tumor activities…”
Fucoidan product:
“New Frontier in Cancer Treatment”
“Fucoidan is a powerful anticancerous supplement from the Sea.”
“Fucoidan…triggers the natural immune system to attack and kill cancer cells.”
“Fucoidan suppresses the generation of new blood vessels around cancer cells, cutting off their nutrient supply. This also prevents the cancer cells from spreading.”
“Fucoidan provides an anticancer effect by way of inducing apoptosis.”
“Fucoidan reduces side effects of chemotherapy and radiation.”
In addition, the FDA has observed that your website offers “Immune Health” for sale in the United States, which is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19)1. On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS2. In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-193.
Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
The claims on your website www.duocthaotrexanh.com , that establish the intended use of your product and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
Immune Health product:
“COVID-19 Influenza”
“Helps Boost Your Immune System Against: Coronavirus…Influenza…Bronchitis…Dyspnea…Common Cold”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced use and, therefore, the product is “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Immune Health, Ganoderma Lucidum Red Reishi Mushroom, Papaya Leaf Extract and Fucoidan are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Immune Health, Ganoderma Lucidum Red Reishi Mushroom, Papaya Leaf Extract and Fucoidan fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations.We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use or other medical diseases for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.

Re: 612586
Dear Mr. Azhar:
This is to advise you that in January 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the label for your 16-ounce Super Caffeine (Anhydrous) product, which is labeled and offered for sale as a dietary supplement on your website http://www.wholesalecentral.com/trippo/store.cfm. Your product appears to be offered in powdered form, and its labeling lists “caffeine anhydrous” as the sole ingredient.
Based on our review, we have determined that your 16-ounce Super Caffeine (Anhydrous) product is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(f)(1)(A)(i) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(A)(i)] because it is a dietary supplement that presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Your 16-ounce Super Caffeine (Anhydrous) product label states, “Serving Size: 200 milligrams Total Servings Per Container 2267.” The directions on your product label further state, “Recommended use 200mg up to 2 times daily. Allow 3 to 4 hours between servings. Do not exceed more than 400 mg for 2 doses per day.”
A serving size of 200 milligrams cannot be accurately measured using common household measuring tools. Many consumers do not have a scale that is sufficiently precise to accurately measure such a small amount. Furthermore, a simple mistake such as measuring a serving in grams, rather than milligrams, could result in a dangerous or even toxic dose.
Caffeine is a powerful stimulant. A single teaspoon of pure powdered caffeine is roughly equivalent to the amount in 28 cups of coffee1(approximately 2.7 grams2). Consuming as little as one teaspoon of caffeine has been associated with symptoms including nausea, vomiting, anxiety, and heart palpitations. Consuming as little as one tablespoon (equivalent to 3 teaspoons or approximately 8.1 grams) of caffeine has been associated with symptoms including chest pain, hypokalemia, elevated blood glucose, tachycardia, bigeminy, agitation, respiratory alkalosis, irregular heartbeat, and in some cases, even death.
Your 16-ounce Super Caffeine (Anhydrous) product consists of a package containing 16 ounces of powdered caffeine, which is approximately 454 grams. This is over 2,000 servings of your product, using your recommended serving size of 200 milligrams. The conditions of use suggested by your labeling appear to imply that consumers have ready access to a very precise scale, when in fact that is not the case. In light of the potential toxicity of your product; the fact that your product is packaged to contain an amount that is potentially lethal many times over; and the fact that the packaging requires the consumer to use a precise scale to separate out a safe serving from this potentially lethal amount; we have determined that your product presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling.
Moreover, a review of your website also shows that you sell similar-appearing products in package sizes ranging from 1 ounce to amounts less than 16 ounces. Based on the information we have reviewed for these products they appear to be similar to your 16-ounce product and would thus present the same issues. Even your 1-ounce product appears to contain well over 100 servings, a potentially lethal amount.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
This letter notifies you of our concerns and provides you an opportunity to address them. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address any violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written reply should be directed to PowderedCaffeine-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.

1The USDA nutrition database reports that one cup (8 oz) of ground coffee contains 95 mg of caffeine: http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/4287.
2Due to the nature of producing a powdered crystalline substance, there may be differences in the density of different powdered caffeine products even when the products are the same chemical substance. Our reported values for a teaspoon and tablespoon of powdered caffeine are based on peer reviewed literature, which indicates that the poured bulk density of powdered caffeine is 0.55 g/mL and therefore one standard teaspoon is 2.7 g and one standard tablespoon is 8.1 g.

WARNING LETTER
Case# 603584
Dear Mr. DeVisser:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your drug manufacturing facility, BioLyte Laboratories, LLC, FEI 3013171766, located at 310 Northern Dr. NW, Grand Rapids, MI, from December 9 to 18, 2019 and on February 13, 2020.
This warning letter summarizes significant violations of current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) regulations for finished pharmaceuticals and misbranding regulations for dietary supplements. See Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), parts 210 and 211 (21 CFR, parts 210 and 211) and 21 CFR 101, respectively. Because your methods, facilities, or controls for manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to CGMP, your drug products are adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B). Introduction or delivery for introduction of adulterated products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Your firm manufactures the products “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray,” which are unapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). In addition, your “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” are also misbranded under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352. Introduction or delivery for introduction of misbranded products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a) and 352. These violations are described in more detail below.
Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Charges
We reviewed your January 9, 2020, response to our Form FDA 483 in detail and acknowledge receipt of your subsequent correspondence.
During our inspection, our investigator observed specific violations including, but not limited to, the following.
1. Your firm failed to have, for each batch of drug product, appropriate laboratory determination of satisfactory conformance to final specifications for the drug product, including the identity and strength of each active ingredient, prior to release (21 CFR 211.165(a)).
You released your over-the-counter (OTC) topical drug products without adequate quality control testing, including but not limited to the identity and strength of each active ingredient. For example, identity and potency testing is not performed for the active ingredient in your Topical Pain Relief drug product (Menthol 4%) before release.
Testing is essential to ensure that the drug products you manufacture conform to all pre-determined quality attributes appropriate for their intended use, including both chemical and microbiological specifications. Because you lacked testing of each batch of your drug products, you do not know whether they conform to finished product specifications and are suitable for release to consumers.
In your response, you stated that you were in the process of setting up testing with FDA registered laboratories that have the capability to test for identity and potency of your active pharmaceutical ingredients.
Your response is inadequate. You did not provide adequate justification for the limited testing you proposed in your response.
In response to this letter, provide:
A list of chemical and microbiological specifications, including test methods, used to analyze each batch of your drug products before a batch disposition decision.
Microbiological testing methods that are capable of recovering bioburden in your product and determining whether any microorganisms are objectionable relative to the product’s intended use, route of administration, and patient (i.e., consumer) population. The suitability of all test methods should be verified under actual conditions of use.
A commitment to testing each batch, using qualified methods to ensure conformance to finished product specifications before final disposition.
An action plan and timelines for conducting full chemical and microbiological testing of retain samples to determine the quality of all batches of drug product distributed within the United States and within expiry as of the date of this letter.
A summary of all results obtained from testing retain samples from each batch. If such testing reveals substandard quality drug products, take rapid corrective actions, such as notifying customers and product recalls.
2. Your firm failed to conduct at least one test to verify the identity of each component of a drug product. Your firm also failed to validate and establish the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses at appropriate intervals (21 CFR 211.84(d)(1) and (2)).
You did not perform at least one specific identity test for each component used in production of your OTC and Homeopathic drug products. During the inspection, you stated that you do not perform identity testing of incoming drug components, nor verify or validate supplier’s test results as reported on the Certificates of Analysis (COAs).
In your response, you stated that your raw material receiving procedure would be modified to include identity testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients (API), and also stated that you had contracted a laboratory to perform identity testing of all future API received at your site.
Your response is inadequate. You did not address your failure to test all drug components, including both active and inactive ingredients used in your OTC and homeopathic drug products, for identity and other appropriate specifications before use. Further, your response did not address the failure to establish the reliability of your component supplier’s test analyses at appropriate intervals. You did not address the effect of this deficiency on the quality of all your distributed drug products.
In response to this letter, provide:
A comprehensive review of your material system to determine whether all suppliers of components, containers, and closures are each qualified and the materials are assigned appropriate expiration or retest dates. The review should also determine whether incoming material controls are adequate to prevent use of unsuitable components, containers, and closures.
The chemical and microbiological quality control specifications you use to test and release each incoming lot of component for use in manufacturing.
A description of how you will test each component lot for conformity with all appropriate specifications for identity, strength, quality, and purity. If you intend to accept any testing results on your supplier’s COA in lieu of testing each component lot for purity, strength, and quality, specify in detail how you will first establish the reliability and consistency of your supplier’s test results for these attributes through initial validation (followed by periodic re-validation). In addition, include a commitment to always conduct at least one specific identity test for each incoming component lot.
A summary of your program for qualifying and overseeing contract facilities that perform testing of the components you use in manufacturing your drug products.
A summary of results obtained from testing all components to evaluate the reliability of the COA from each component manufacturer.
A retrospective assessment of all drug product batches within expiry and in distribution within the United States, manufactured using components that were not adequately tested and controlled.
3. Your firm failed to establish a written testing program designed to assess the stability characteristics of drug products and to use results of such stability testing to determine appropriate storage conditions and expiration dates (21 CFR 211.166(a)).
You do not have appropriate stability data to support the 3-year expiration date for the OTC Pain Relief drug product that you manufacture.
During the inspection, you provided evidence that you perform a visual, odor, and pH check of your finished drug product in your stability program. However, you failed to adequately demonstrate that the chemical, physical and microbiological properties of your drug products remain acceptable throughout the labeled 3-year expiry period. Therefore, there is inadequate assurance that your drug products can meet their label claims through their expiration period.
In your response, you stated that you were working with your client to determine a justifiable shelf life for this product, and you committed to test the drug product based on your standard real-time stability timeline as detailed in your updated stability procedure.
Your response cannot be fully evaluated because you did not include your stability study test results used to determine if each of your commercial drug products will meet specifications at the end of the labeled expiration period.
In response to this letter, provide:
A comprehensive assessment, corrective and preventive action plan to ensure the adequacy of your stability program. Your remediated program should include, but not be limited to:
o Stability indicating methodso Stability studies for each drug product in its marketed container-closure system before you permit distributiono An ongoing program in which representative batches of each product are added each year to the program to determine if shelf-life claims remain valido A detailed definition of the specific attributes to be tested at each station (timepoint)
All procedures that describe these and other elements of your remediated stability program.
Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Charges
Unapproved New Drug Violations
Your “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

External Analgesic Drug Products
Based on the above labeling claims, your products “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” are drugs intended for use as external analgesics. We are not aware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream”, or “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions suggested, recommended, or prescribed in their labeling. Thus, these external analgesic drug products are “new drugs” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are nonprescription drugs governed by and lawfully marketed under section 505G1of the FD&C Act, among other exceptions not applicable here. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for any of these external analgesic products, nor are they nonprescription drugs eligible for marketing under section 505G of the FD&C Act, as described below. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Section 505G of the FD&C Act governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application (commonly referred to as over-the-counter or “OTC” drugs), such as your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product.2Under section 505G, eligible nonprescription drug products need not have an approved application for lawful marketing, if certain conditions are met. However, your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product is not eligible for marketing without an approved application under section 505G. Specifically, your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product does not meet the applicable conditions of section 505G(a)(1) or (2) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h(a)(1) or (2), under which nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application are deemed GRASE and not considered “new drugs” by operation of law. Among these conditions is that a drug conforms with the general requirements for nonprescription drugs and that it conforms with the requirements for nonprescription use of a final monograph issued under 21 CFR part 330 or, for drugs classified in Category I for safety and effectiveness under a tentative final monograph (TFM), that a drug conforms with the proposed requirements of such TFM. Your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product does not meet these conditions, notably because the product's active ingredient, magnesium (as described below), was not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or TFM.3
We note that your products “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” are labeled as homeopathic drug products. Under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), the term “drug” includes articles recognized in the official Homeopathic Pharmacopeia of the United States (HPUS), or any supplement to it. Homeopathic drug products are subject to the same statutory requirements as other drugs; nothing in the FD&C Act exempts homeopathic drugs from any of the requirements related to adulteration, misbranding, or approval. As noted above, your ""(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act and are not the subject of an FDA-approved application. Moreover, these products are not eligible to be marketed without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act, because under the CARES Act, section 505G does not apply to homeopathic drugs.4Even if your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products were governed by section 505G, they would not meet the conditions for marketing without an approved application under section 505G, notably because the products’ active ingredient cannabidiol (CBD), as described below, was not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or TFM.5
CBD-containing drug products
Your products “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” are labeled to contain CBD.
Although CBD is labeled as an inactive ingredient in the labels of your “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” and “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” products, the labeling for these products clearly represent CBD as an active ingredient.6For instance, your product label for “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” features the statement, “Pain Relief Cream with(b)(4)rejuvenating CBD,” and the product label for “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” features the statement, “CBD 560mg.” As noted above, CBD was not an active ingredient in any applicable final monograph or TFM, for purposes of establishing eligibility for lawful marketing without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
Furthermore, even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in a nonprescription drug product, that product would still need an approved new drug application to be legally marketed because the product would not be eligible for marketing under section 505G of the FD&C Act. In particular, such product would not meet the conditions under section 505G(a)(1) or (2), insofar as it would not conform with the general requirement in 21 CFR 330.1(e) that inactive ingredients must be safe and suitable.7A suitable inactive ingredient generally provides a beneficial formulation function, such as a tablet binder or preservative, or improves product delivery (e.g., enhances absorption or controls release of the drug substance).8CBD has no known functional role as an inactive ingredient in a finished drug product. Additionally, an inactive ingredient should not exert pharmacological effects9and must be safe when used at the intended dosage.10CBD, however, has known pharmacological activity with demonstrated risks.11It is unknown whether the levels of CBD used in your “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” and “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” products have pharmacological activity or pose any concern for safety events. Accordingly, CBD cannot be considered a safe and suitable inactive ingredient as required under 21 CFR 330.1(e). Moreover, as explained above, your “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” and “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” products are labeled as homeopathic drug products and thus are ineligible for marketing without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act.
Magnesium-containing drug product
Similarly, although your firm does not specifically list magnesium oil as an active ingredient on the label of your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product, the product labeling clearly represents magnesium as an active ingredient. For instance, the label includes the statement, “[r]esearch shows magnesium can ease stress, anxiety, muscle/joint pain, and headaches, and aid in promoting restful sleep.” Because as noted magnesium was not an active ingredient under any applicable final monograph or TFM, your ""(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product would not meet the conditions for lawful marketing without an approved application under section 505G(a)(1) or (2). This product would also be ineligible for marketing without an approved application under section 505G(a)(1) or (2) because its labeling is inconsistent with the conditions applicable to OTC external analgesics, in that the product claims regarding easing of stress and anxiety reflect indications not included under the external analgesic TFM.12
In addition to failing to meet the conditions for marketing under section 505G(a)(1) or (2) of the FD&C Act, your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product does not meet the other conditions under section 505G under which nonprescription drug products can be lawfully marketed without an approved application. Specifically, it does not satisfy the requirements under sections 505G(a)(3)13nor is its marketing permitted by an order issued under section 505G(b)(1).14Your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products also cannot meet such other marketing conditions because they are inapplicable, given that these products are labeled as homeopathic drug products which, again, are not governed by section 505G.
For the above reasons, your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), 331(d).
Silver-containing Drug Products
Based on their labeling, your products “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” and “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement” are drugs that contain silver as an active ingredient. Further, these products lack an approved application and are made available for purchase by consumers without a prescription, i.e., OTC. Accordingly, these products are subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, which as noted above governs nonprescription drugs marketed without an approved application. Specifically, your silver products fall under section 505G(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, because under a final determination issued under 21 CFR part 330, as published in the Federal Register on August 17, 1999,15the Agency has determined that no silver containing OTC drugs are GRASE under section 201(p)(1) of the FD&C Act and that all such products are deemed to be new drugs and require an approved new drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act to be lawfully marketed.16
New drugs may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved application from FDA in effect, as described in section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a), unless they are eligible to be marketed without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act, among other exceptions not applicable here. No FDA-approved application pursuant to section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, is in effect for your firm’s “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” drug products. Nor are these products eligible to be marketed without an approved application under section 505G of the FD&C Act. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
Misbranded Drugs
Your “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” products are misbranded drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and 331(a).
As explained above, your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray,” ""(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” and “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement"" products are nonprescription drugs subject to section 505G of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h, but do not comply with the requirements for marketing under that section, and are not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355. Consequently, these products are misbranded under section 502(ee) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee). In addition, your silver-containing products ""(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” and “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement"" are misbranded under section 502 of the FD&C Act by virtue of 21 CFR 310.548(b).17
Furthermore, your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products are also misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act because the labeling of these products is false and misleading for several reasons. First, the labeling for your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products identifies CBD as an inactive ingredient, but represents CBD as having purported active pharmacological properties such as pain relief, among others. Even if CBD could be considered an inactive ingredient in these products, the prominent featuring of CBD on the labeling on your “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel” and “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream” products causes the products to be misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, which deems a drug to be misbranded if its labeling is “false or misleading in any particular,” and under 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4). Under 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4), “[t]he labeling of a drug may be misleading by reason … [of] the featuring in the labeling of inert or inactive ingredients in a manner that creates an impression of value greater than their true functional role in the formulation.” Similarly, although the labeling for your ""(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product does not specifically list magnesium oil as an active ingredient, your labeling claims represent magnesium as an active ingredient, as described above, and thus this product is also misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act and 21 CFR 201.10(c)(4).
Accordingly, your “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel,” “(b)(4)Silver Gel with Aloe,” “(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,” “(b)(4)Therapeutic Pain Gel,” “(b)(4)Pain Relief Cream,” and “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” products are misbranded drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352 and 331(a).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement (even if not considered an unapproved new drug and/or a misbranded drug),(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver Water, and(b)(4)Silver products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101, as follows:
1. Your(b)(4)Silver and(b)(4)Silver Water products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (e)(1)] in that the label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
2. Your(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver(b)(4), and(b)(4)Silver products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the products do not present nutrition information on the labeling as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:
Your(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver(b)(4), and(b)(4)Silver products labels fail to list the serving sizes which include 1 teaspoon twice daily for people under 75 pounds (lbs.) and 2 teaspoons twice daily for people over 75 lbs. If the product is for persons within more than one group, the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E)
3. Your(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver(b)(4), and(b)(4)Silver products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(s)(2)(B)] because the product labels do not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
4. Your(b)(4)Silver and(b)(4)Silver(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761 of the Act) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
Additionally,
1. Your(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver(b)(4), and(b)(4)Silver product labels bear the following statement: “DV (Daily Value) based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, added sugars, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
2. Your(b)(4)Silver Liquid Supplement,(b)(4)Silver,(b)(4)Silver(b)(4), and(b)(4)Silver product labels are using an incorrect version of the FDA disclaimer. This FDA disclaimer is only required when certain statements as mentioned in 21 CFR 101.93(f) are declared on the label.
CGMP consultant recommended
Based upon the nature of the violations we identified at your firm, we strongly recommend engaging a consultant qualified as set forth in 21 CFR 211.34 to assist your firm in meeting CGMP requirements. We also recommend that the qualified third party perform a comprehensive audit of your entire operation for CGMP compliance and evaluate the effectiveness of your corrective actions and preventive actions.
Your use of a consultant does not relieve your firm’s obligation to comply with CGMP. Your firm’s executive management remains responsible for fully resolving all deficiencies and systemic flaws to ensure ongoing CGMP compliance.
Any drug marketed by your firm must conform with all applicable requirements of the FD&C Act, including those outlined in the Unapproved New Drug and Misbranding Charges section of this letter.
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.
Failure to promptly correct any violations may result in legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Failure to address violations of the FD&C Act may be cause for FDA to withhold approval of requests for export certificates and approval of pending new drug applications or supplements listing your facility as a supplier or manufacturer. We may re-inspect to verify that you have completed your corrective actions.
This letter notifies you of our findings and provides you an opportunity to address the above deficiencies. After you receive this letter, respond to this office in writing within 15 working days. Specify what you have done since our inspection to address any violations and to prevent their recurrence. In response to this letter, you may provide additional information for our consideration as we continue to assess your activities and practices.

2Your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” is made available for purchase by consumers without a prescription.
3We note that OTC drug products intended for external analgesic indications, such as the temporary relief of pain, were addressed in the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983). As noted above, magnesium was not included as an active ingredient under this TFM.
4See section 3853(a) of the CARES Act, Pub. L. 116-136 (March 27, 2020).
5See Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983). As noted above, CBD was not included as an active ingredient under this TFM. 6 Under 21 CFR 201.66(b), an active ingredient is a component of a drug intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body.
721 CFR 330.1(e) requires that ""the product contains only suitable inactive ingredients which are safe in the amounts administered and do not interfere with the effectiveness of the preparation or with suitable tests or assays to determine if the product meets its professed standards of identity, strength, quality, and purity"".
8See e.g., ""Using the Inactive Ingredient Database"" Guidance for Industry (July 2019), p. 1 athttps://www.fda.gov/media/128687/download, and ""Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients"" Guidance for Industry (May 2005), pp. 1-2 athttps://www.fda.gov/media/72260/download.
9See e.g., 21 CFR 314.3(b) and 21 CFR 210.3(b)(7), which define an active ingredient as “any component that is intended to furnish pharmacological activity or other direct effect in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or to affect the structure or any function of the body of man.” All other components of a finished drug product are considered inactive ingredients (see CFR 314.3(b), 21 CFR 210.3(b)(8)).
10See 21 CFR 330.1(e).
11For example, the labeling for Epidiolex (cannabidiol) prescription oral solution includes risks for the drug such as liver injury, interactions with other drugs or supplements, potential for male reproductive toxicity, somnolence, insomnia, diarrhea, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, upset stomach, changes in mood, irritability, and agitation. Seehttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2020/210365s005s006s007lbl.pdf.
12See Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for External Analgesic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use (external analgesic TFM; 48 FR 5852, February 8, 1983). As noted above, easing of stress and anxiety were not indications included under this TFM.
13Under 505G(a)(3) of the FD&C Act, drugs that were classified as Category III for safety or effectiveness in a TFM that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination issued under 21 CFR Part 330 -- and that were not classified as Category II for safety or effectiveness -- are not required to have an approved application under section 505 in order to be marketed, as long as they are in conformity with the relevant conditions of use outlined in the applicable TFM, including labeling conditions, and comply with all other applicable requirements for nonprescription drugs. Drugs containing magnesium as an active ingredient were not classified under any applicable TFM as Category III for safety or effectiveness. Thus, your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product does not meet the conditions under section 505G(a)(3) for lawful marketing absent an approved application.
14Your “(b)(4)Magnesium Oil Spray” product is not the subject of an order issued under section 505G(b)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 355h(b)(1), under which it is considered GRASE and can be lawfully marketed without an approved application.
15See 64 FR 44653, 44658 (Aug. 17, 1999) establishing 21 CFR 310.548(a), which states in relevant part that ""…there is a lack of adequate data to establish general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts for OTC use in the treatment or prevention of any disease. These ingredients and salts include, but are not limited to, silver proteins, mild silver protein, strong silver protein, silver, silver ion, silver chloride, silver cyanide, silver iodide, silver oxide, and silver phosphate"".
16Id. at 21 CFR 310.548(b): ""Any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing. In the absence of an approved new drug application or abbreviated new drug application, such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the act"".
17See 64 FR 44653, 44658 (Aug. 17, 1999), establishing 21 CFR 310.548, which at 21 CFR 310.548(b) states that ""Any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients or silver salts that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) for which an approved application or abbreviated application under section 505 of the act and part 314 of this chapter is required for marketing.

WARNING LETTER
March 1, 2021
RE: 611957
Dear Mr. Chaney:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://cannafyl.com in November 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, all of which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/cannafyl, https://twitter.com/cannafyl, and www.instagram.com/cannafylcbd/; these websites direct consumers to your website https://cannafyl.com to purchase your products. In addition, the FDA has observed that your website offers CBD-containing products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that all strengths and varieties of your “Balance CBD Drops,”2“Relief CBD Drops,”3“Relax CBD Drops,”4and “Relief CBD Salve”5(hereinafter all referred to as “your CBD-containing products for humans”) are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). In addition, your “Pet CBD Drops”6is an unapproved new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and is adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.7In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19.8Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of any unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://canafyl.com/ indicates that you intend to market your “Balance CBD Drops,” “Relief CBD Drops,” and “Relax CBD Drops” as dietary supplements. However, your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.9There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.10
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

On your website https://cannafyl.com/blog/researchers-explore-how-cbd-might-positively-affect-covid-19/: August 12, 2020 blog posting titled “Researchers Explore how CBD Might Positively Affect COVID-19”:
“While researchers continue to explore several ways to fight against COVID-19, some are diving a little deeper to see if cannabis derived CBD could possibly benefit those that are suffering from severe forms of this infection. Further research has suggested that CBD is perhaps able to reduce the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression, which is used as a cell receptor to invade human cells. . . . At Cannafyl we formulated a full-spectrum CBD infused with natural terpenes and essential oils giving you all the health benefits that a CBD product can provide, and the great news is you don’t need that much CBD to receive all of the health benefits.

Your CBD-containing products for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your website, https://cannafyl.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/cannafyl, https://twitter.com/cannafyl, and www.instagram.com/cannafylcbd/, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drug “Pet CBD Drops.” Based on our review of your website and social media websites, your “Pet CBD Drops” is a drug under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and marketing it violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website https://cannafyl.com, and your social media websites, www.facebook.com/cannafyl, https://twitter.com/cannafyl, and www.instagram.com/cannafylcbd/ that establish the intended use of your “Pet CBD Drops” as a drug include, but are not limited to, the following:

Your “Pet CBD Drops” product is a “new animal drug” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because it is not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. This product is not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of this adulterated drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

9CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
10We also note that the labeling for your “Balance CBD Drops,” “Relief CBD Drops,” and “Relax CBD Drops” recommends sublingual administration (under the tongue). The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Because sublingual products are intended to enter the body directly through mucosal tissues, they are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Balance CBD Drops,” “Relief CBD Drops,” and “Relax CBD Drops” products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act for this additional reason.

WARNING LETTER
Ref.: 21-HFD-45-02-02
Dear Dr. Dunn:
This Warning Letter informs you of objectionable conditions observed during the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspection conducted from August 4 to August 13, 2020. Investigator Iris C. MacInnes, representing FDA, reviewed the role of KDunn and Associates, P.A. dba HealthQuilt (hereinafter referred to as HealthQuilt) as the sponsor of the following clinical investigation of the investigational drug(b)(4)(also referred to as(b)(4)) (hereinafter referred to as(b)(4)): “An Open-label Pilot Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of(b)(4)in Subjects and Their Quarantined Close Contacts Who Test Positive for COVID-191.” During the inspection, FDA also reviewed your conduct as a clinical investigator of the clinical investigation referenced above.
This inspection was conducted as a part of FDA’s Bioresearch Monitoring Program, which includes inspections designed to evaluate the conduct of research and to help ensure that the rights, safety, and welfare of human subjects have been protected.
At the conclusion of the inspection, Investigator MacInnes presented and discussed with you Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge our receipt of HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response to the Form FDA 483.From our review of the FDA Establishment Inspection Report, the documents submitted with that report, and HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response to the Form FDA 483, we conclude that HealthQuilt, as the sponsor, and you, as the clinical investigator, did not adhere to the applicable statutory requirements and FDA regulations governing the conduct of clinical investigations and the protection of human subjects. We wish to emphasize the following:
1. You failed to submit an IND for the conduct of clinical investigations with an investigational new drug that is subject to 21 CFR 312.2(a) [21 CFR 312.20(a), 312.20(b), and 312.40(a)].
In relevant part, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) defines the termdrugas “articles intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease” and “articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of man or other animals” [21 U.S.C. 321(g)]. HealthQuilt studied the efficacy and safety of(b)(4)in subjects who had tested positive for COVID-19 or who were close contacts of subjects who had tested positive, to determine whether and to what extent(b)(4)has antiviral properties, helps patients with COVID-19 recover faster, and prevents transmission of disease. Because the product was intended for the treatment, cure, and prevention of COVID-19, it meets the definition of a drug under the FD&C Act.(b)(4)is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses, and therefore this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)].
To market a new drug lawfully, with certain exceptions not applicable here, a sponsor must obtain FDA approval of either a new drug application or an abbreviated new drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 355]. An Investigational New Drug application (IND) allows a sponsor to obtain an exemption from this requirement in order to distribute an investigational drug [21 U.S.C. 355(i)]. FDA regulations require a sponsor to submit an IND before conducting a clinical investigation of a drug in human subjects, unless the clinical investigation qualifies for an IND exemption under 21 CFR 312.2(b). That regulation provides an exemption from the requirement to obtain an IND before initiating a clinical investigation of a drug ifallthe following exemption criteria are met:
• The drug product is lawfully marketed in the United States.• The investigation is not intended to be reported to FDA as a well-controlled study in support of a new indication for use, and there is no intent to use the investigation to support any other significant change in the labeling of the drug.• In the case of a lawfully marketed prescription drug, the investigation is not intended to support a significant change in the advertising for the drug.• The investigation does not involve a route of administration, dosage level, use in a patient population, or other factor that significantly increases the risks (or decreases the acceptability of the risks) associated with the use of the drug product.• The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements for institutional review set forth in 21 CFR part 56 and with the requirements for informed consent set forth in 21 CFR part 50.• The investigation is conducted in compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.7.
This clinical investigation of(b)(4)failed to meet at least the first criterion. The investigational drug(b)(4)used in the study was an unapproved new drug, administered to human subjects(b)(4)for(b)(4)to treat, cure, and prevent COVID-19.(b)(4)is not a lawfully marketed drug product in the United States and therefore was not exempt from the IND requirements. Before using(b)(4)in a clinical investigation, HealthQuilt was required to submit an IND to FDA and to have an IND in effect under 21 CFR 312.40. FDA records indicate that HealthQuilt failed to submit an IND before conducting a clinical investigation, in which(b)(4)human subjects were enrolled.
HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response to the Form FDA 483 stated, “[O]ur intent in conducting this study was to evaluate the use of(b)(4)as a dietary supplement only.” HealthQuilt also stated that, while it acknowledged and deferred to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research that an IND was required, it did not intend to submit the results of the study in support of the product’s approval as a new drug. In addition, HealthQuilt stated that it is in the process of working with legal counsel to develop new policies and procedures regarding the initiation of future clinical studies, to ensure that such studies are conducted in compliance with 21 CFR part 312. HealthQuilt’s response is inadequate because, as discussed above,(b)(4)is a drug under section 201(g) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)].
Further,(b)(4)cannot be a dietary supplement because it does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under 201(ff) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)].(b)(4), the investigational product used in your study, contains the(b)(4). Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that products containing(b)(4)are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii)]. Under this provision, if an article (such as(b)(4)) has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that article are outside the definition of a dietary supplement, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before it was authorized for investigation as a new drug.(b)(4)has been previously authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public.2Further, FDA is not aware of any evidence that(b)(4)was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before being authorized for investigation as a new drug. Therefore, under 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(ii),(b)(4)is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement and may not be marketed as or in a dietary supplement.3
In addition,(b)(4)is intended for sublingual administration. The FD&C Act defines the termdietary supplementin section 201(ff)(2)(A) [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(A)] as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Because sublingual products are intended to enter the body directly through the skin or mucosal tissues, they are not intended for ingestion. Therefore,(b)(4)does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act for this additional reason.
Because(b)(4)is a drug under section 201(g) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)], and because this clinical investigation did not qualify for an exemption under 21 CFR 312.2 from the requirement to submit an IND, HealthQuilt was required to submit an IND for this clinical investigation before initiating the study and before enrolling human subjects, even if it did not intend to submit the results of this study to FDA for approval. There are no FDA records to indicate that HealthQuilt submitted an IND before conducting the clinical investigation of(b)(4). We note that(b)(4)human subjects were enrolled at three clinical sites for this study. Subjects were administered(b)(4), an unapproved drug,(b)(4)for(b)(4)for the treatment, cure, and prevention of COVID-19.
Moreover, HealthQuilt’s corrective action plan does not provide sufficient details about how it would determine whether future clinical studies fall under the requirements of 21 CFR part 312. Without these details, we are unable to determine whether HealthQuilt’s corrective action plan is adequate to prevent similar violations in the future.
2. You failed to maintain adequate records showing the receipt, shipment, or other disposition of the investigational drug (21 CFR 312.57(a)).
As a sponsor, HealthQuilt was required to maintain adequate records showing the receipt, shipment, or other disposition of the investigational drug(b)(4). These records were required to include, as appropriate, the name of the investigator to whom the drug is shipped, and the date, quantity, and batch or code mark of each shipment. HealthQuilt failed to maintain adequate records with respect to the investigational drug(b)(4). Specifically, HealthQuilt did not maintain any records showing receipt, shipment, or other disposition of the investigational drug.
HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response indicated that its understanding was that the requirements of 21 CFR part 312 were not applicable. HealthQuilt noted that it did not perceive any significant risk to the security of the product during transport, since it was delivered to HealthQuilt from the manufacturer in a private vehicle. HealthQuilt also indicated that for any future shipments received, records will be maintained as required under 21 CFR 312.57(a) using an inventory management system, and that, for any future studies, it would use a QR code/bar code tracking system.
HealthQuilt’s written response is inadequate because it did not provide sufficient details about its plan for implementing additional measures and procedures to address the inspection findings concerning its failure to maintain adequate records. As a result, we are unable to determine whether HealthQuilt’s plans appear sufficient to prevent similar violations in the future.
3. You failed to obtain informed consent in accordance with the provisions of 21 CFR part 50 [21 CFR 312.60 and 21 CFR 50.20].
As a clinical investigator, it is your responsibility to obtain informed consent in accordance with 21 CFR part 50. FDA's regulations at 21 CFR 50.20 state that, except as provided in 21 CFR 50.23 and 50.24, no investigator may involve a human being as a subject in research covered by the regulations unless the investigator has obtained the legally effective informed consent of the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative. No informed consent, whether oral or written, may include any exculpatory language through which the subject or the representative is made to waive or appear to waive any of the subject’s legal rights, or releases or appears to release the investigator, the sponsor, the institution, or its agents from liability for negligence.The informed consent forms for the above-referenced clinical investigation were not in compliance with these regulations because the informed consent forms included the following statement:
“Subject agrees to waive, release, forever discharge and hold harmless the Schull Institute, KDunn and Associates, PA, HealthQuilt, Investigator,(b)(4)(maker of the supplement) its owners, principals, shareholders, investors, managers, employees, partners, attorneys, officers, directors, predecessors, successors, and assigns, from and against any and all claims, demands, causes of action or suits arising out of any type of physical, psychological or other financial injury, loss or damage, including but not limited to illness, paralysis, death, loss of earnings, economic or emotional loss, that may occur as a direct or proximate result of participation in the study.”
HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response indicated that the understanding was that the requirements of 21 CFR part 50 did not apply because the study protocol was developed to monitor patients’ treatment and not to support any research or marketing application. It was noted that language for the informed consent was provided by the manufacturer,(b)(4). As a corrective action, this written response indicated that, going forward, any language purporting to release an investigator, sponsor, institution, or their agents from liability for negligence will be removed from any informed consent form subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 50.
We are unable to determine if this written response provides a corrective action plan that, if properly carried out, would prevent this type of violation in the future. Specifically, this written response does not provide sufficient details about how you would determine whether future clinical studies fall under the requirements of 21 CFR part 50. Without these details, we are unable to determine whether your corrective action plan for removing exculpatory language from informed consent forms for studies subject to the requirements of 21 CFR part 50 is adequate to prevent similar violations in the future.
4. You failed to retain records required to be maintained under 21 CFR part 312 for a period of two years following the date a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which the drug is being investigated; or, if no application is filed or if the application is not approved for such indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued [21 CFR 312.62(c)].
As a clinical investigator, you are required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories that record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each individual administered the investigational drug or employed as a control in the investigation. You are required to retain these records for a period of two years following the date on which a marketing application is approved for the drug for the indication for which it is being investigated; or, if no application is to be filed or the application is not approved for such an indication, until two years after the investigation is discontinued and FDA is notified.
You failed to adhere to these requirements. You were required to retain case histories, including informed consent forms, for a period of two years following discontinuation of the investigation, which was on July 23, 2020; however, you failed to retain at least eight signed and dated informed consent forms.
HealthQuilt’s August 27, 2020, written response indicated that each subject whose original paper informed consent form could not be located was contacted to confirm that consent was obtained before starting the study. As a corrective action, it was indicated that, going forward, informed consent would be archived automatically into the subject’s folder.
This written response is inadequate because it did not provide sufficient details about your plans for implementing additional measures and procedures to address the inspection findings regarding failure to retain records. For example, this written response did not address how you will retain study records for the required retention period. As a result, we are unable to determine whether your plan appears sufficient to prevent similar violations in the future.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of deficiencies with this clinical study of an investigational drug. It is your responsibility to ensure adherence to each requirement of the law and relevant FDA regulations. You should address these deficiencies and establish procedures to ensure that any ongoing or future studies comply with FDA regulations.
Within fifteen (15) working days of your receipt of this letter, you should notify this office in writing of the actions you have taken to prevent similar violations in the future. Failure to address the violations noted above adequately and promptly may result in regulatory action without further notice. If you believe you have complied with the FD&C Act and FDA regulations, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you believe that HealthQuilt’s written response to the Form FDA 483 dated August 27, 2020, fully explains the actions you have taken to prevent similar violations in the future, please communicate that to us in writing within fifteen (15) business days. You may refer to the written response dated August 27, 2020, in your response to this letter.
If you have any questions, please call Mark S. Miller, Pharm.D., at301-796-2798. Alternatively, you may e-mail FDA at CDER-OSI-Advisory@fda.hhs.gov. Your written response and any pertinent documentation should be addressed to:

February 11, 2021
RE: 609772
Dear Mr. Radina:
This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.biocbdplus.com from August through October 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for “BioCBD+ Total Body Care,” “BioCBD+ Topical Oil Muscle & Joint Support,” and “BioCBD+ Peace Vape” (hereinafter referred to as your “BioCBD+ products”) that claim to contain cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/BioCBDPlus and https://www.instagram.com/bio_cbd_plus/; these social media websites direct consumers to your website http://www.biocbdplus.com to purchase your products. In addition, we observed that your website offers CBD products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. The claims on your website and social media websites establish that your BioCBD+ products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs sold in violation of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Furthermore, your “BioCBD+ Peace Vape” product is particularly concerning to the agency because the ingredients and potential impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm and bronchospasm and may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways. Inhalation products that are intended to act locally in the respiratory system also may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects, such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Your “BioCBD+ Total Body Care” product is labeled as a dietary supplement. However, it cannot be a dietary supplement because it does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded that, based on available evidence, CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act. Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement. There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD.2FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.
Unapproved New Drug Products
Based on our review of your websites, your BioCBD+ products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Some examples of claims observed on your website and social media websites that established the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your website, www.biocbdplus.com:
From the webpage titled “Health Benefits of Vaping CBD”:
“May Support Depression and Mood Disorders”
“If you suffer from depression or other mood disorders, vaping CBD may be as effective at fighting these issues as pharmaceuticals, but without the drawbacks and side effects, especially those that are all too common with benzodiazepines such as: Addiction . . . Sexual dysfunction [and] Substance Abuse”
“May Prevent Bone Disease”
“Reduces the risk of osteoporosis and osteoarthritis.”
“May Help Improve Cholesterol and Decrease the Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases”
“Decreased cardiovascular inflammation and inflammatory response.”
“Slower atherosclerosis progression.”
From the webpage titled “CBD for Children with Autism”:
“CBD for autism isn’t a traditional treatment, as of now, but could soon be because CBD is both an anti-oxidant and an anti-inflammatory . . ..”
“CBD for autism could help because CBD is a powerful antioxidant with neuroprotective properties that protect the brain against neurodegenerative disorders.”
CBD for autism has the following beneficial effects: Anxiolytic. (Reduce anxiety)[,] Anti-inflammatory. (Reduces brain swelling)[,] Antiemetic. (Prevents vomiting) [and] Antipsychotic.”
From the webpage titled “CBD for PTSD: The All-Natural Alternative”:

Your BioCBD+ products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for your BioCBD+ products.
Misbranded Drug Products
Your BioCBD+ products are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for your products. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly address these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail to FDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

1There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, there was a Presidential declaration of a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.
2CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

Re: 610642
Dear Dr. Lewis Clarke M.D. and M. Christopher Clarke:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.clarkepharmaceuticals.com in December 2020 and January 2021, and has determined that you take orders there for the products “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream.” We have also reviewed your YouTube video recordings posted under the account “Clarke Pharmaceuticals”; your YouTube channel directs consumers to your website www.clarkepharmaceuticals.com to purchase your products. In addition, we observed that your “Cell Block #19” product is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. The claims on your website establish that the products “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream” are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
OsteoBLAST®
On your product webpage for “OsteoBLAST®” at https://www.clarkepharmaceuticals.com:
“OsteoBLAST® is designed to . . . reducing osteoporosis risk”
“Tags: … Fracture, Osteoporosis”
“Researchers have found that strontium [an ingredient in your OsteoBLAST® product] improves cartilage metabolism in osteoarthritis ….”
“[L]ow vitamin A [an ingredient in your OsteoBLAST® product] levels are associated with osteoporosis and increased risk of fracture.”
On your YouTube video recording at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dln-NOCM2_E titled “OsteoBLAST Video”:
02:27-02:59: “I’ve used my OsteoBlast in many patients, severe osteoporosis patients … with broken bones and they’ve healed in a fraction of the expected time.”

Cell Block #19On your product webpage for “Cell Block #19” at https://www.clarkepharmaceuticals.com:
“Tags: allergies, cancer, COVID-19, Flu …”
“This compound is designed to strengthen your immunity to viruses and bacterial infection.”
“Studies have shown that vitamin A [an ingredient in your Cell Block #19 product] . . . increases the immunoglobulin igA which coats all our mucus epthelium [sic] in our noses, lungs, GI tract. IgA is a front line barrier to bacteria like staph, strep, etc. AND to virus entry into the epithelial cells which is the beginning of the great tribulation of viral infections like pneumonias and influenzas and HIV and measles . . . IgA drastically suppresses the release of viruses, specifically studied in influenza viruses, from infected cells which would infect other cells. … So vitamin A is making IgA which blocks and imprisons the virus.”
“Vitamin D [an ingredient in your Cell Block #19 product] proteins pair up with Vitamin A proteins in what is called a heterodimer. This complex can then bind to a Vitamin D receptor and this causes the CAMP gene in immune cells to secrete peptides defensin, cathelicidin and LL-37 all of which simply put, KILL BUGS! Both viruses and bacteria.”
On your YouTube video recording at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbZ_1pQNbAE titled “Vitamin A and Vitamin D for Virus Protection.”
00:22-00:36: “What if I told you about two simple over-the-counter vitamins that you can use right now to hedge your bets against COVID-19 and potentially keep you out of the ICU and off a ventilator.”
02:16-02:24: “Vitamin A and Vitamin D [ingredients in your Cell Block #19 product] work both together and separately to augment the function of the immune system and suppress inflammation.”
03:45-04:00: “I think it’s clear that all infections—viral, bacterial, parasitic, and fungal infections—must have adequate if not super doses of Vitamin A and D. These steroid vitamins are preventive of influenzas as per the volumes of supportive scientific literature.”
Video Description: “Cell Block #19 High dose vitamin A and D …. These [vitamins] can be used for flu season, as well as hedging your bets against a viral outbreak.”

Your “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no approved applications under section 505 for your “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream” products. Accordingly, these products are unapproved new drugs marketed in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C 355(a) and 331(d).
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream” products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, “OsteoBLAST®,” “Cell Block #19,” “High Potency Vitamin D3,” “Neupanex®,” and “Natural Progesterone Skin Cream” products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].

Your Lion's Mane -All Natural Supplement, Antrodia Mushroom Powder, Maitake Mushroom Powder, Reishi Mushroom Powder, Cordyceps Mushroom Powder, and Cordyceps -All Natural Mushroom Dietary Supplement products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, the products are ""new drugs"" under section 201 (p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321 (p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301 (d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331 (d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). ""Adequate directions for use"" means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.Your products Lion's Mane -All Natural Supplement, Antrodia Mushroom Powder, Maitake Mushroom Powder, Reishi Mushroom Powder, Cordyceps Mushroom Powder, and Cordyceps - All Natural Mushroom Dietary Supplement are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Lion's Mane -All Natural Supplement, Antrodia Mushroom Powder, Maitake Mushroom Powder, Reishi Mushroom Powder, Cordyceps Mushroom Powder, and Cordyceps - All Natural Mushroom Dietary Supplement products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301 (a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331 (a)].

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Montgomery:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the internet address www.speedwinds.com in December 2020, and has determined that you take orders there for the products Synotrex and Sephren. We also reviewed your website at www.speedwindsnutrition.com, which contains links to www.synotrex.com and www.sephren.com where the products can be purchased. Furthermore, we reviewed www.amazon.com where you sell Synotrex. The claims on your websites and Amazon storefront establish that the Synotrex and Sephren products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
Synotrex

On the webpage titled, “Turmeric :: Synotrex Ingredients” at www.synotrex.com/join-pian-turmeric.html:• “For thousands of years, turmeric [an ingredient in your Synotrex product] has also been sued [sic] as an anti-inflammatory supplement. It is known to be a pain relieving agent as well, and a 2006 issue of ‘Arthritis and Rheumatism’ recognized the effects of turmeric for reducing joint inflammation, treating arthritis symptoms and inhibiting an enzyme known as cox-2, which has been shown to lessen neuropathic pain, Turmeric has also been shown to reduce melanoma (cancer) cells as well as prevent psoriasis and cystic fibrosis. It may even slow the spread of breast cancer.”• “A UCLA research center found that turmeric may be useful in preventing some of the destruction to Alzheimer's patients, as the active ingredient in Turmeric (curcumin) has been shown to inhibit the production of beta almyloids.”• “[I]t's [sic] anti-inflammatory properties as well as its ability to reduce pain make it a useful herbal supplement for preventing joint pain cause by osteoarthritis.”
On the webpage titled, ""SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine) :: Synotrex Ingredients” at www.synotrex.com/join-pian-sam-e.html:• “SAM-e (S-adenosylmethionine) [an ingredient in your Synotrex product] … is used in Europe as an all natural anti-depressant as well as a pain killer for joint pain.

On the webpage titled, “HAIR LOSS IN WOMEN” at www.sephren.com/hair-loss-in-women, which contains links to purchase your Sephren product:• “[M]ajor surgery can also cause changes in the body that can lead to hair loss . . . Problems with the thyroid gland or immune system of the body can also cause hair loss. Some medications such as non-steroidal pain relievers, chemotherapy drugs and antidepressants can also cause hair loss.”• “With Sephren, you can feel confident that Sephren will: . . . Stop the root causes of hair [sic] female hair loss.”
On the webpage titled, “CAUSES OF FEMALE HAIR LOSS” at www.sephren.com/female-hair-loss, which contains links to purchase your Sephren product:• “Telogen Effluvium . . . occurs after some kind of stressful event on the body . . .

Stop the root causes of hair [sic] female hair loss.”
Your website www.synotrex.com also contains evidence of intended use in the form of quotes attributed to media organizations and personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Synotrex for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such media and personal testimonials include:• “Clearly, research has demonstrated that chondroitin [an ingredient in your Synotrex product], especially when taken with glucosamine [an ingredient in your Synotrex product], has shown a benefit for those suffering from osteoarthritis. To discourage its use as a treatment option is ill-considered, particularly when the alternatives are limited or nonexistent.”• “After suffering a knee injury in college 20 years ago, I have been dealing with bad knee pain. I've tried all kinds of stuff, but no matter what, nothing really makes it feel better. My wife saw an ad for Synotrex, so she bought me some. I took it reluctantly, but amazingly enough it really worked. Synotrex has made a huge difference and am now able to be active again.”• “Before finding Synotrex, I was really starting to miss out on a lot life's special moments. I've had arthritis for years and have always struggled with it. I found Synotrex online and it seemed to address my needs. after [sic] using it consistently for 4 months, I'm a new person. My RA has gotten a lot better and more importantly, I can keep up with my grandchildren. I no longer feel like I'm missing out!”• “[A] friend recommended Synotrex, and I’ve rediscovered what it’s like to live without joint pain.”
Your Synotrex and Sephren products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Furthermore, your Synotrex product is offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use this drug safely for its intended purposes. Thus, this drug is misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the Act, in that its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is a violation of section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to address the violations noted in this letter and establish and implement procedures that will prevent the recurrence of these violations and the occurrence of other violations. Failure to adequately address this matter may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to address violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, Attention: Jinkee M. Vila-Binayug, Compliance Officer, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact Compliance Officer Vila-Binayug at425-302-0413.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Ho:
This is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://bonagensinc.com in July 2020, and has determined that you take orders there for the products “Anti-Aging Supports,” “Cholesterol & Diabetes Control,” “Gout Control,” “Hypertension Control,” “Liver Supports,” “Lungs Supports,” “Vita-V for Men,” and “Weight Lost.” The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Anti-Aging Supports• “alleviate the effects of menopausal syndrome…menopausal and sleeping disorders”• “prevent and aid in rehabilitation from strokes”• “alleviate cataract problems”• “aide [sic] in osteoporosis”
Cholesterol & Diabetes Control• “Administration of Cholesterol/Diabetes Control has a significant decrease in fasting blood glucose and suppression of glucose elevation. It also stimulates the insulin secreting cell lines and helps to control blood glucose.”• “Cholesterol/Diabetes Control will lower the total cholesterol, triglyceride, and LDL level. Consumption of this product will decrease hepatic cholesterogenesis, where as [sic] the triacylglycerol -lowering effect appears to be due to inhibition of fatty acid synthesis.”• “Cholesterol/Diabetes Control will also help to increase levels of HDL by the synthesize [sic] of more apoA -I, apoA -II from intestines and liver.”
Gout Control• “Gout Control will help to reduce the uric acid by blocking the enzyme Xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH), this is one of the key enzymes to form uric acid in the liver. Gout Control also helps to increase the excretion of uric acid via gastrointestinal tract and bile.”• “Gout Control prevents inflammation, infection, …”
Hypertension Control• “Hypertension Control helps to remove nanoplaque. Nanoplaque is a compound that deposits onto the wall of the cells, which leads to clogged arteries and artherosclerosis [sic]. Hypertension Control will stop blood clots and lower overall cholesterol level, which will stop high blood pressure.”
Liver Supports• “Control liver enzyme AST/ALT, prevent hepatitis, and liver cancer. Hedyotis diffusa reduced liver cell damage caused by antibody-dependent cell mediated toxicity or activated marcrophage [sic] culture supernatants.”• “Against chemical-induced liver damage (including industrial chemicals, alcohol and pharmaceutical drugs)”• “Liver cirrhosis”• “Hepatitis”• “Gallbladder dysfunctions”
Lungs Supports• “Prevent coughing, inflammation, infection, and lung cancer.”• “Individuals with symptoms of bronchitis”• “Individuals with symptoms of breath problem, cold, flu, asthma”• “Individuals with symptoms of respiratory-induced allergies”• “Individuals working at facilities, considered at risk factor [sic] for respiratory disease”
Vita-V for Men• “Ginkgo Biloba blocks many of the effects of platelet activating factor PAF (blood clots) which is a common cause for erectile dysfunction and impotence.”
Weight Lost• “In local tissues, liver, and adipose tissue, Weight Lost administration significantly reduced…abnormal phenotypical changes in both tissues.”Your “Anti-Aging Supports,” “Cholesterol & Diabetes Control,” “Gout Control,” “Hypertension Control,” “Liver Supports,” “Lungs Supports,” “Vita-V for Men,” and “Weight Lost” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products, “Anti-Aging Supports,” “Cholesterol & Diabetes Control,” “Gout Control,” “Hypertension Control,” “Liver Supports,” “Lungs Supports,” and “Vita-V for Men” are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, “Anti-Aging Supports,” “Cholesterol & Diabetes Control,” “Gout Control,” “Hypertension Control,” “Liver Supports,” “Lungs Supports,” and “Vita-V for Men” fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.

RE: 609572

Dear Ms. Carter:
This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.glwellness.net in August and December 2020 andhas determined that youtake ordersthere[1]forthe “C BETTER DAILY Adult Regular Formula,” “C BETTER DAILY Adult Maximum Formula,” and “C BETTER DAILY Soothing Formula,” (hereinafter collectively referred to as “your C BETTER DAILY products for humans”) all of which you promote as eye drop products containing cannabidiol (CBD) for human use.The claims on your website establishthatyour C BETTER DAILY products for humansare unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). FDA has also determined that you take orders for the product “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” on your website at www.glwellness.net. This product, which you promote as an eye drop product containing CBD, is an unapproved new animal drug that is unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
These products are especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans and/or animals if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your websites, your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.glwellness.net and/or label of your products that establish their intended uses as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On yourproduct labelfor “C BETTER DAILY Adult Maximum Formula”:
""MULTI SYMPTOM EYE CARE”
On your product webpage for “C BETTER DAILY” at your website www.glwellness.net, you state:

“A harmonic blend of herbal extracts chosen for their ability to reduce swelling, itching and inflammation.”
“Antioxidant”
“Anti-Inflammatory”
Under“Intended for Daily Use”:“Organic chamomile hydrosol is the base of all our formulas, chosen for its long-standing history of traditional use as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and mild astringent.”
“Organic chamomile hydrosol is the base of all our formulas, chosen for its long-standing history of traditional use as an anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and mild astringent.”
Under “Research”:“G & L Wellness had introduced the world’s first and only hemp derived multi symptom eye care solution for both people and pets and they quickly started to make their way across the country and the world!”“Applications of CBD as an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, neuroprotective and vasodilator compound are well researched and documented.”“Both minor and major eye related issues are beginning to be clinically researched as to what role the ECS [endocannabinoid system] and the receptors, enzymes and endocannabinoids within play to the overall health and longevity of our eyes.”“N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is present in three of our formulas, Maximum, Regular and Pet in various concentrations. It is a powerful antioxidant.

YourC BETTER DAILY products for humansarenot generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a) unless they are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your C BETTER DAILY products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act,21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website www.glwellness.net, FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drug “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula.” Based on our review of your website, your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, this product is an unapproved new animal drug and marketing it violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.glwellness.net that establish the intended uses of this product include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your product webpage for “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” at your website www.glwellness.net, you state:
Under a rotating banner titled “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula”:“A harmonic blend of herbal extracts chosen for their ability to reduce swelling, itching and inflammation.”
“A harmonic blend of herbal extracts chosen for their ability to reduce swelling, itching and inflammation.”
Under “Research”:“[T]he world’s first and only hemp derived multi symptom eye care solution for both people and pets…”“Applications of CBD as an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, neuroprotective and vasodilator compound are well researched and documented.”
“[T]he world’s first and only hemp derived multi symptom eye care solution for both people and pets…”
“Applications of CBD as an anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, neuroprotective and vasodilator compound are well researched and documented.”
Under “Consumer Commonly Asked Questions”:“Ingredients in C Better Daily may reduce pain, inflammation and redness…”
“Ingredients in C Better Daily may reduce pain, inflammation and redness…”
Your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula” product is a “new animal drug,” as defined by section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because it is not generally recognized among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling. To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. Your “C BETTER DAILY Pet Formula”  product is not approved, conditionally approved, or index listed by the FDA, and therefore this product is considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of this adulterated drug into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion

Dear Skyler R. Johnstone:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at www.beedelightful.com in October 2020 and determined you take orders for the products “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” (250 mg and 500 mg concentration) in bottles and “snap packs,” which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/BeeDelightfulUSA; this website directs consumers to your website, www.beedelightful.com to purchase your products. In addition, we observed that your website offers CBD products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. The claims on your website and social media website establish that your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). FDA has also determined that your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C 331(II) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll). As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links to FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.Additionally, you can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fdaregulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drug
Based on our review of your website, your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C § 321(g)(1), because they are articles intended for the use in in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.

Your May 19, 2020 post:
“‘Researchers developed over 400 new cannabis Sativa lines and extracts. The end-strains were high in anti-inflammatory cannabinoid cannabidiol (CBD) since the compound has been proposed to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.
By using artificial human 3-D tissue models, they simulated and mapped out how each strain may impact COVID-19 infections in the human oral, airway, and intestinal tissues. Particularly, they monitored each strain's ability to modulate ACE2 levels, an enzyme previously linked to COVID-19 infection.
The lead researcher, biological scientist Dr. Igor Kovalchuk stated some strains showed promising results in ensuring less fertile ground for the virus to take root.
Some reduced the virus receptors by 73%.
According to Kovalchuk, ‘A number of them have reduced the number of these (virus) receptors by 73 percent, the chance of it getting in is much lower. If they can reduce the number of receptors, there’s much less chance of getting infected.’
Moreover, the researchers were able to identify 13 CBD extracts that are able to change ACE2 levels. The data suggested that some strains were also able to down-regulate serine protease TMPRSS2, which is another protein critical for COVID-19 to enter host cells and spread throughout the body.’ . . . #covid19 #coronavirus #cannabis #cbdhoney #cannabees #cbd”Your December 16, 2018 post:
“No wonder Grandma loves our raw honey so much! Raw Honey and Diabetes What Your Doctor Isn’t Telling You . . . ‘Using raw honey for diabetes improves the effectiveness of medications according to this study!’”
Your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses; therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(d) and 355(a) unless they are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for the above-named products.
In addition, your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1). A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1), if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (See 21 CFR 201.5). The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use this drug safely for its intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved application is in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C § 331(II), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.2There is an exception if thesubstance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are a food, honey, to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these products is a prohibited act under section 301(II) of the FD&C Act.
Furthermore, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.3
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C § 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C § 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potentials for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria from GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “Canna Bees Rescue Blend” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a).

1There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS. In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19. Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
2CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See Sativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer Pain and GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
3Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.

RE: 609604

Dear Mr. Cocheu:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at https://wbrxglobal.com in September and December 2020, andhas observed that you take orders there for “WBRx Metered-Dose Inhaler,” “WBRx Balance Softgels CBD,” “WBRx Pure Wellness CBD” (“WBRx Combo Pack”), “WBRx Energy Oil Drops CBD,” “WBRx Relief Balm CBD,” and “WBRx Sleep Oil Drops CBD” (hereinafter referred to as “your CBD products”), all of which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media website at https://www.twitter.com/wellnessbiosrx, whichdirects consumers to your website https://wbrxglobal.com to purchase your products.The claims on your website and social media website establish that yourCBD products areunapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs sold in violation of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1).
Your“WBRx Metered-Dose Inhaler” is intended to deliver CBD through oral inhalation and, according toyour webpage https://wbrxglobal.com/blog/dr-jasani-the-timely-release-of-the-wbrx-metered-dose-inhaler/, you state “CBD has proven to be a great anxiolytic with no addiction or overdose potential and the WBRx MDI inhaler provides this plant based CBD compound in aerosolized form through an inhaler that makes it extremely bioavailable.” This product is particularly concerning to the agency because the ingredients and potential impurities in oral inhalation sprays may trigger laryngospasm and bronchospasm and may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways. Inhalation products that are intended to act locally in the respiratory system also may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects, such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your websites, your CBD products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your websites that establish the intended use of your CBD products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your website https://wbrxglobal.com/blog/study-finds-cbd-may-be-powerful-nootropic-by-boosting-brain-blood-flow/; from an August 17, 2020 blog posting by Barry Cocheu titled “Study Finds CBD May Be Powerful Nootropic by Boosting Brain Blood Flow”:
“Cannabidiol, more commonly called CBD, has grown in popularity as a medicinal substance, with users claiming a variety of benefits ranging from better sleep to pain relief and more. Select past research has linked the compound with improvements in psychiatric issues, such as easing PTSD, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms in sufferers. As well, there have been indications that CBD may help reduce dementia symptoms in people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease . . ..”
On your websitehttps://wbrxglobal.com/blog/cbd-your-immune-system/; from a July 7, 2020 blog posting by Barry Cocheu titled “CBD & Your Immune System”:
“How does CBD affect the immune system? . . . CBD acts as an immunosuppressive agent, tied closely with its anti-inflammatory activity, which helps downregulate overactive immune or autoimmune responses that play prominent roles in disease processes such as multiple sclerosis, diabetes, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, and many cancers or malignant conditions . . . CBD is able to achieve immunosuppression, by binding CB2 receptors . . . directly causing cell death, inhibiting proliferation/recreations, decreasing immune chemical signalers, and upregulating T regulating cells. . . . [L]et’s have a quick look at the specific disease process and immune responses in the body that are affected by CBD . . . Alters lipid metabolism increasing anandamide (an endocannabinoid) . . .

On your website https://wbrxglobal.com/studies-trials-and-important-resources/; webpage titled “Studies, Trials, and Important Resources”:
“Cannabidiol in Anxiety and Sleep: A Large Case Series[,] Objective: To determine whether CBD helps improve sleep and/or anxiety in a clinical population. Conclusion: Cannabidiol may hold benefits for anxiety-related disorders.”
“Trial of Cannabidiol for Drug-Resistant Seizures in the Dravet Syndrome[,] Background: The Dravet syndrome is a complex childhood epilepsy disorder that is associated with drug-resistant seizures and a high mortality rate. We studied cannabidiol for the treatment of drug-resistant seizures in the Dravet syndrome. Result: Among patients with the Dravet syndrome, cannabidiol resulted in greater reduction in convulsive-seizure frequency than placebo and was associated with lower rates of adverse events.”
On your Twitter social media website https://Twitter.com/wellnessbiosrx:
February 17, 2020 Retweet – “CBD may help with smoking cessation. 24 smokers were assigned a CBD inhaler or a placebo inhaler for one week. . . . The CBD inhaler group reduced their cigarette consumption by 40%.”
April 8, 2019 Retweet – “Smokers who were given a CBD inhaler reduced their cigarette consumption by around a whopping 40%” accompanied by a graphic displaying the text “CBD May Help Smokers Quit Cigarettes, Finds New Study”
YourCBD products arenot generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses; therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C.331(d) and 355(a), unless they are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for your CBD products.
Misbranded Drugs
A drug is misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(a), if itslabeling is false or misleading in any particular. Your CBD products aremisbranded, as discussed further below.
Your website homepage and the webpage for “WBRx Metered-Dose Inhaler” include the following statements:
“Discover the amazing benefits of 99% pure CBD in an instant with the only CBD inhaler officially filed with FDA.”
“The only FDA-filed CBD MDI device on the market! . . . THE COMFORT OF FDA QUALITY . . . Each WBRX MDI is produced at a certified cGMP facility in an ISO 8 Clean Room that meets the stringent guidelines required for FDA approval and the WBRx MDI is currently in the process of being approved by the FDA.”
These claims are false or misleading because they suggest that a new drug application has been filed for your “WBRx Metered-Dose Inhaler” , when the agency has neither approved nor reviewed this product. Therefore your “WBRx Metered-Dose Inhaler” product is a misbranded drug under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act.[1]
In addition, your CBD products are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) Your products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners. Therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. Under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction of a misbranded drug into interstate commerce is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Prohibited Act under 301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your “WBRx Balance Softgels CBD,” “WBRx Energy Oil Drops CBD,” and “WBRx Sleep Oil Drops CBD” products appear to be promoted as conventional human foods. For example, these products are displayed with a Nutrition Facts label on your website. However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.[2]There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[3]
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(a), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 321(s), and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 USC 348. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food.
We also note that your website indicates that melatonin is an ingredient in your “WBRx Sleep Oil Drops CBD” product.  You should be aware that there is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of melatonin. We are not aware of any information to indicate that melatonin is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR 181).
Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that melatonin is GRAS for use in conventional foods.We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for melatonin based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958 (see 21 CFR 170.30). Melatonin is a neurohormone that is used for medicinal purposes, primarily as a sleep aid in the treatment of sleep-related disorders.  Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of melatonin in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. On the contrary, reports in the scientific literature have raised safety concerns about the use of melatonin.  Among these are concerns about effects on blood glucose homeostasis, and effects on the reproductive/developmental, cardiovascular, ocular and neurological systems.  Therefore, based on our review, the use of melatonin in conventional food products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to melatonin for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, melatonin added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the Act, 21 USC 321(s), and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the Act, 21 USC 348.  Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. Melatonin is not approved for use in any conventional food.
Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).

[1]We also note that Nutrition Facts labels are appropriate only for foods (see generally section 403(q) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 343(q), and 21 CFR 101.9).
[2]CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex.  (SeeSativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer PainandGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect.  Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
[3]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(s), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

RE: 610446

Dear Mr. Cabarus and Mr. Rodriguez:
This letter is to advise you that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.thisstuffisgoodforyou.com in September and December 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/tsigfy and https://www.instagram.com/tsigfy; these websites direct consumers to your website www.thisstuffisgoodforyou.com to purchase your products. In addition, we observed that your website offers CBD products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1]in people. The claims on your website and social media website establish that all strengths and varieties of your CBD products for human use[2]are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans, are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). In addition, your products reLeaves 40mg CBD Pet Shampoo, reLeaves Full-Spectrum CBD Dried Dog Treat Cookies (all strengths), reLeaves CBD Broad Spectrum Tincture (all varieties), and reLeaves CBD Full Spectrum Tincture (all varieties) are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5).
The Agency is particularly concerned that you market your CBD products for use in children. For example, a February 11, 2020 post on your Facebook page at https://www.facebook.com/tsigfy, includes a graphic that features a young child beside the statement “CBD FOR CHILDHOOD ADD/ADHD.” Your post states “How Does CBD Oil Help Kids with ADHD? . . . you can use CBD to treat ADHD . . .  #ADD #ADHD #ChildhoodADD #ChildHealth #CBDoil #CBDforADD #CBDforADHD #HempCBD.” Your products have not been evaluated by the Agency for safety, effectiveness, and quality. The use of untested drugs can have unpredictable and unintended consequences, especially in vulnerable populations such as children who may be at greater risk for adverse reactions associated with certain drug products due to differences in the ability of children to absorb, metabolize, distribute, or excrete such drug products or their metabolites.
In addition, your CBD Vape products are particularly concerning to the agency because the ingredients and potential impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm and bronchospasm and may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways. Inhalation products that are intended to act locally in the respiratory system also may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects, such as increased heart rate or elevated blood pressure.
Further, your reLeaves Vision+ 20mg CBD Eye Drops product is especially concerning from a public health perspective because ophthalmic drug products can pose serious risk of harm to humans and/or animals if toxic substances are introduced directly into the eye because irreversible damage, including vision loss, can result.
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov. You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD athttps://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your websites, your CBD products for human use are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website at www.thisstuffisgoodforyou.com and your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/tsigfy and https://www.instagram.com/tsigfy that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:

YourCBD products for human usearenot generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a) unless they are over-the-counter (OTC) drugs lawfully marketed under section 505G of the FD&C Act (which is not the case for these products). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your CBD products for human useare also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act,21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
We note that your CBD Sleep Syrup (all flavors), Day Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s, Night Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s, Chronic Candy CBD Infused Lollipop (all flavors and strengths), and Chronic Candy CBD Gourmet Chocolate Budz (all flavors) products appear to be promoted as conventional human foods. For example, your product webpages for your CBD Sleep Syrup products direct consumers to “[p]our . . . into a favorite beverage and ENJOY!” You describe your Day Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s and Night Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s as “delicious.” Additionally, both your CBD Infused Lollipops and your CBD Gourmet Chocolate Budz are sold under the “Chronic Candy” brand. Furthermore, your CBD Infused Lollipops product webpages state, “[i]ndugle your tastebuds in a classic lollipop treat,” and that “[f]eeling great just became that much tastier!” Your CBD Gourmet Chocolate Budz product webpages describe them as “chocolate treats.”  However, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD.[3]There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted.

Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website, www.thisstuffisgoodforyou.com, and your social media sites, https://www.instagram.com/tsigfy and https://www.facebook.com/tsigfy/,FDA determined that your firm is marketing the unapproved new animal drugs reLeaves 40mg CBD Pet Shampoo, reLeaves Full-Spectrum CBD Dried Dog Treat Cookies (all strengths), reLeaves CBD Broad Spectrum Tincture (all varieties), and reLeaves CBD Full Spectrum Tincture (all varieties). Based on our review of your websites, your productsreLeaves 40mg CBD Pet Shampoo, reLeaves Full-Spectrum CBD Dried Dog Treat Cookies (all strengths), reLeaves CBD Broad Spectrum Tincture (all varieties), and reLeaves CBD Full Spectrum Tincture (all varieties) are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body of an animal. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.

These products are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Animal Foods
Moreover, to the extent that you market any of your products containing CBD as animal food, you should be aware that it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any animal food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD, as described above.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term “food additive” refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any animal food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.[5]
There is no animal food additive regulation that authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in animal foods. FDA’s regulations in 21 CFR 570.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of an animal food ingredient as GRAS. The use of an animal food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in animal food before 1958, through experience based on common use in animal food (see 21 CFR 570.30). We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in animal food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of the publicly available literature, the data and information necessary to support the safe use of CBD in animal foods are lacking. In fact, literature reports have raised safety concerns for animals consuming CBD, including, but not limited to, male reproductive toxicity and liver toxicity. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in animal products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 570.30.
Under section 409 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 348, an animal food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any animal food. Animal food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated animal food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Conclusion
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to address the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly address these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to address these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete addressing these violations within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will do so.
Your response should be sent to U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research/Office of Compliance/Office of Unapproved Drugs and Labeling Compliance by e-mail toFDAADVISORY@fda.hhs.gov.

[1]There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.  In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.  Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
[2]Your CBD products for human use include but are not limited to: your reLeaves Vision+ 20mg CBD Eye Drops, your tinctures, such as reLeaves CBD Broad Spectrum Tincture (all varieties) and reLeaves CBD Full Spectrum Tincture (all varieties), your topical products, such as reLeaves Maximum Strength Muscle Gel (all varierties), your CBD vape products, such as TKO CBD Vape Oil, your capsule products, such as reLeaves CBD Full Spectrum (all varieties), your CBD Sleep Syrup (all flavors), your Day Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s, your Night Time CBD Vegan Gummy’s, your Chronic Candy CBD Infused Lollipop (all flavors and strengths) and your Chronic Candy CBD Gourmet Chocolate Budz (all flavors).
[3]CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (SeeSativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer PainandGW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
[4]Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.
[5]Under section 201(s)(5) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)(5)), new animal drugs are excluded from the food additive definition. If a new animal drug is unsafe within the meaning of section 512 because it is not approved for use in animal food, then the animal food is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(ii) of the FD&C Act.

The metatags are:- Website Description: “Ayur Dia Life® Herbal Dietary Supplement helps to control diabetes and high blood pressure.”- Website keywords: “Control Diabetes . . . Control High Blood Pressure . . . Controls Sugar Level . . . Helps in healing of wound”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of “Heritage of Ayurveda Dia-Tonic Incudil Herbal Dietary Supplement” for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
Numerous customer statements referencing a diabetes health claim were observed on your testimonial page www.ayurdiatonic.com/testimonials/. Examples include:- Review from(b)(6), (b)(7)(C): “This is the very best Blood Sugar Support supplement you can get if you’re trying to beat Type-2 Diabetes once and for all...""- Review from(b)(6), (b)(7)(C): “I am doctor . . . . The product does an excellent job in controlling my A1C . . . I am happy because my A1C is reduced by 30%....""- Review from(b)(6), (b)(7)(C): “Dia-Tonic Incudil is a good way to help keep your diabetes undercontrol [sic] without prescription drugs.”
Your “Heritage of Ayurveda Dia-Tonic Incudil Herbal Dietary Supplement” product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your “Heritage of Ayurveda Dia-Tonic Incudil Herbal Dietary Supplement” product is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, “Heritage of Ayurveda Dia-Tonic Incudil Herbal Dietary Supplement” fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each steps being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.

RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.hotzehwc.com and www.hotzevitamins.com on September 10, 2020 and November 3, 2020, respectively. We also reviewed your social media websites at www.facebook.com/Hotze-HWC/, www.facebook.com/MyHotzeVitamins/, www.twitter.com/hotzehealth.com, and www.twitter.com/HotzeVitamins/, where you direct consumers to your website www.hotzevitamins.com to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website www.hotzevitamins.com offers the products “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak with Vitamins A, B, C, D, Zinc and Probiotics” (sometimes referred to on your websites as “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak” or “Dr. Hotze’s Immune Pak for Adults”), “Dr. Hotze’s Kids Immune Pak,” and “Dr. Hotze’s Teen Immune Pak” for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19  in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19).

• “Dr. Hotze: . . . I was on Fox News on March the 15th, Sunday afternoon, on the coronavirus pandemic report. . . And I talked about the importance of vitamin A, B, C, D and Z with the probiotic, and I made my case and said, ‘Build up your immune system that’s what you need to do. If you have a healthy immune system, you’re not going to have to worry about this virus or that virus or this bacterial infection, you’re going to be healthy. And that’s what you can do and you need to do that now through . . . the vitamins you take . . .’ I mean, the lady looked at me and she goes, ‘We don’t really believe vitamins and all those things can help you with the coronavirus.’ Well of course it can.”

You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter.  This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.  Within 48 hours, please send an email to COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.  Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products.

RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)] reviewed your website at the Internet address https://heavenlynaturalproducts.com on September 11, 2020, and November 10, 2020, respectively. We also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/heavenlyc60, https://twitter.com/hnpC60, and https://www.pinterest.com/heavenlynaturalproductsc/, where you direct consumers to your website https://heavenlynaturalproducts.com/ to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers various C60 (Carbon 60) and colloidal silver products for sale in the United States, including “AVOCADO C60 ANTI-VIRAL COMBO – VIRUS PREVENTION” (which includes the products “C60 WITH AVOCADO” and “Heavenly Silver”), and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19  in people.  Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.  In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.  Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your products, based on statements about the purported effects of their ingredients, and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
From your blog post titled “C60 and Coronavirus,” https://heavenlynaturalproducts.com/blogs/news/c60-and-coronavirus:
• Under the heading “HOW C60 MAY HELP FIGHT AGAINST CORONA VIRUS”:
o “Some of the common therapeutic potentials of C60 that may be useful to people suffering from COVID-19 have been summarized below . . .”
o “Improved antioxidant activity:C60 is an excellent antioxidant, 172 times higher strength than vitamin C.  This means it has the capacity to produce a more visible effect than vitamin C.  One of the reasons why Vitamin C was recommended as a treatment plan for COVID-19 is due to its antioxidant activities, and this can be improved by using C60 compounds.”
o “C60 possess some antiviral characteristics”
o “The potential antiviral activities of C60 have been reported against HIV, and possible interest is rising concerning how C60 may also play the same role in controlling COVID-19 even though HIV and COVID-19 belong to different families.”
o “In Summary, as the burden of COVID-19 increases and spread to unaffected areas, there is a need to develop an antiviral therapy that will assist both infected and non-infected patients to stay healthy.  These moves led to the endorsement of Vitamin C as one of the first lines of treatment for infected cases.  It is believed that C60 can also play an active in … modulating immune responses in patients, and prevents exposure to the virus.”
From your blog post titled “The Benefits of Colloidal Silver (Anti-Viral),” https://heavenlynaturalproducts.com/blogs/news/the-benefits-of-colloidal-silver-anti-viral:
• “Colloidal silver is an ancient remedy commonly utilized for its . . . anti-viral activities.”
• In a paragraph describing the antimicrobial properties of colloidal silver: “It’s also been widely used to help prevent other viruses like the coronavirus develop in otherwise healthy individuals.”
• “. . . Colloidal Silver serves as an excellent healing agent, limiting the spread of . . . viral infections. It is recommended to be used daily as a preventative measure against disease, as well as the prevention of viral infections common in our society.”

• “C60 AND CORONAVIRUS . . . Since the antioxidant and immune-boosting activities of Vitamin C have been shown to play significant roles in the treatment and management of COVID-19, researchers are positive that Carbon-60 (C60) may play a better role at easing the COVID-19 burden. People who have used C60 products have reported a stronger immune system with less exposure to respiratory infections like flu, and there is presently a high demand for C60 in major parts of the world affected with the COVID-19.” [from your pin on your Pinterest website, https://www.pinterest.com/pin/670051250798001380/, which links to your blog post titled “C60 and Coronavirus” at https://heavenlynaturalproducts.com/blogs/news/c60-and-coronavirus]

WARNING LETTER
Dear Dr. Holt:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility in Loris, SC from February 19, 2020 to February 21, 2020. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, found at Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplements to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 United States Code (U.S.C.) §342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Additionally, we reviewed product labels and brochures collected during our inspection, along with your firm’s website at http://foryouinc.com, which we reviewed in July 2020. Based on our review, we concluded that certain products are in violation of sections 403, 505(a), and 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343, 355(a), and 352(f)(1)], as described further in this letter.
You can find copies of the Act and pertinent regulations through links on FDA’s homepage atwww.fda.gov.
UNAPPROVED NEW DRUGS AND MISBRANDED DRUGS
FDA reviewed your product labels and brochures for your Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Calcium pHactor, Colostrum, Honey Bee Pollen, Inner Cellular Energy Multi-Vitamin, J-genics, Thin-Ergy A.M., Thin-Ergy BOOST, Tree of Life Olive Leaf Extract, and Youth Factor with DHEA products, and FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address http://foryouinc.com, where you take orders for your products. The claims on your product labels, brochures, and website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.

Your Advanced BioEnzymes tri-fold brochure also contains evidence of intended use in the form of a personal testimonial recommending or describing the use of the product for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Specifically, the brochure bears the claim, “Before using these products I . . . suffered from acid reflux at night and constant heartburn during the day . . . Now, I am free from these.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)(1)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § § 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Calcium pHactor, Colostrum, Honey Bee Pollen, Inner Cellular Energy Multi-Vitamin, J-genics, Thin-Ergy A.M., Thin-Ergy BOOST, Tree of Life Olive Leaf Extract, and Youth Factor with DHEA are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Advanced BioAnti-Oxidants, Advanced BioEnzymes, Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Calcium pHactor, Colostrum, Honey Bee Pollen, Inner Cellular Energy Multi-Vitamin, J-genics, Thin-Ergy AM, Thin-Ergy BOOST, Tree of Life Olive Leaf Extract, and Youth Factor w/DHEA products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].

Your dietary supplement products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packaged, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulation for dietary supplements (21 CFR Part 111). Additionally, even if your Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Calcium pHactor, Colostrum, Honey Bee Pollen, Inner Cellular Energy Multi-Vitamin, J-genics, Thin-Ergy A.M., Thin-Ergy BOOST, Tree of Life Olive Leaf Extract, and Youth Factor with DHEA products did not have therapeutic claims which make them unapproved new drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the products have been held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulation found at 21 CFR Part 111. The significant violations included the following:
1. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection, your management told our investigator that you did not have any written procedures for quality control operations.
To the extent that you contract with other firms to manufacture your product that your firm releases for distribution under your firm’s name, your firm has an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution [72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34790 (Jun. 25, 2007)]. Although a firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations, it cannot contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplement it places into commerce (or causes to be placed into commerce) is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement cGMP requirements. In particular, the Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section 402(g) for failure to comply with dietary supplement cGMP requirements (see 21 U.S.C. 342(g) and 331(a)). Thus, a firm that contracts out some or all of its operations must establish a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.55). The quality control personnel must ensure that the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.105). Further, quality control must approve for release, or reject, any packaged and labeled dietary supplement (including a repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement) for distribution, and you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.127(h) and 111.140(b)(2)].
We have reviewed your response letter, dated March 13, 2020; however, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. Your response states that you have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place and that it has been implemented. However, you did not provide supporting documentation with your response, so we are unable to evaluate the corrections. We will evaluate that adequacy of your corrective actions at our next inspection.
2. You must establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, to comply with 21CFR Part 111.453. Specifically, your firm receives and distributes dietary supplement products, but, during the inspection, your management told our investigator that you had not established and implemented written procedures for the holding and distribution of these products.
We have reviewed your response letter, dated March 13, 2020. Your response states that you have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place and that it has been implemented. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide supporting documentation with your response. We will evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions at our next inspection.
3. You must establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to the review and investigation of product complaints, to comply with 21 CFR Part 111.553. During the inspection, our investigator determined that you have received product complaints related to your Ancient Sea Mineral Complex product. However, your management told our investigator that you had not established and implemented written procedures for the review and investigation of product complaints.
We have reviewed your response letter, dated March 13, 2020.Your response states that you have a standard operating procedure (SOP) in place and that it has been implemented. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide supporting documentation with your response. We will evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions at our next inspection.
4. You must establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to returned dietary supplements, including the procedures for the conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, to comply with 21 CFR Part 111.503. However, during the inspection, your management told our investigator that your firm has not established and followed these written procedures.
We have reviewed your response letter, dated March 13, 2020. Your response states that you will be implementing a record and/or procedures for handling returned dietary supplements. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide supporting documentation with your response. We will evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions at our next inspection.
MISBRANDED DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS
Your dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. Additionally, even if your Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Calcium pHactor, Colostrum, Honey Bee Pollen, Inner Cellular Energy Multi-Vitamin, Thin-Ergy A.M., Thin-Ergy BOOST, and Youth Factor with DHEA products did not have therapeutic claims which make them unapproved new drugs, these products would be misbranded dietary supplements within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343].
1. Your Honey Bee Pollen product is misbranded with the meaning of section 403(a)(1) Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the labeling of the product is false and misleading. Specifically, your website at the internet address www.foryouinc.com, where you take orders for your products, makes the statement “Honey Bee Pollen contains all the vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, essential proteins (25% pure protein), amino acids, enzymes, co-enzymes, and hormones known to man . . . Contains 34% amino acid protein.” However, according to the product’s Supplement Facts Label, the product does not contain all the vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, essential proteins (25% pure protein), amino acids, enzymes, co-enzymes, and hormones known to man or 34% amino acid protein. Therefore, the labeling for your product is false or misleading within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act.
2. Your Thin-Ergy AM product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(u) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(u)] in that the product labeling purports to contain ginseng, but the purported ginseng ingredient is not from a plant classified with the genus Panax. Section 403(u) of the Act, added by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (Pub. L. 107-171), provides that the term ""ginseng"" may only be considered to be a common or usual name (or part thereof) for any herb or herbal ingredient derived from a plant classified within the genus Panax. For example, your brochure, “The Boss of Weight Loss,” shows the Thin-Ergy AM product contains an ingredient identified as Siberian Ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus) and your website www.foryouinc.com lists Siberian Ginseng as an ingredient in the Thin-Ergy AM product. That ingredient may not be declared under a name that includes the term ""ginseng"" because it is not from the genus Panax.
3. Your Pure Chlorella products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product labeling bears nutrient content claims, but the products do not meet the requirements to make such claims. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act. Specifically, your brochure “Pure Chlorella” makes statements which compare the nutrient content of the product to nutrients in other foods, including:
“Six times more beta-carotene than spinach;
More dietary fiber than leading fruits and vegetables”
Under 21 CFR 101.54(e), a relative claim using the term ""more"" may be used on the label or in labeling of foods to describe the level of protein, vitamins, minerals, dietary fiber, or potassium, except as limited by 101.13(j)(1)(i) and except meal products as defined in 101.13(l) and main dish products as defined in 101.13(m), provided that:(1) the product contains at least 10 percent more of the Reference Daily Intake or Daily Reference Value for the nutrient per reference amount customarily consumed than an appropriate reference food,(2) where the claim is based on nutrients that are added to the food, that the fortification is in accordance with the policy on fortification of foods in 21 CFR 104.20, and(3) the claim bears the required information for relative claims as described in 21 CFR 101.13(j)(2) and 101.54(e)(1)(iii).
Your Pure Chlorella product label and labeling do not state the identity of a reference food and the percentage (or fraction) of the amount of the nutrient(s) in the reference food by which the nutrient(s) in the labeled food differs. Therefore, the product does not meet the requirements for ""more"" claims under 21 CFR 101.54(e)(1) and is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act because the labeling bears the nutrient content claim ""more"" but does not comply with the regulations governing the use of this claim.
4. Your Advanced BioEnzymes and Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
a. The Advanced BioEnzymes label’s directions state to “take one capsule three times daily,” but the serving size listed in the Supplement Facts label is 3 capsules.b. The Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin label’s directions state to “take two capsules per day, one in the morning, one in the evening.” Thus, the amount recommended on the label per eating occasion is 1 capsule, but the serving size listed in the Supplement Facts label is 2 capsules.
5. Your Youth Factor and Life’s First Food Colostrum products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
a. The Youth Factor product label declares the dietary ingredient DHEA, but this is not the common or usual name for this dietary ingredient.b. The Life’s First Food Colostrum product label fails to declare the source of the dietary ingredient colostrum in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
6. Your Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, Calcium pHactor, Thin-Ergy Jr., Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin, Prostate Formula, and Thin- Ergy AM products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. The Advanced BioEnzymes product label fails to list the quantitative amount by weight for each of the dietary ingredients as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A).b. The Calcium pHactor label lists Vitamin D in the wrong order. Vitamin D, its quantitative amount by weight per serving, and percent of the daily value should be listed before calcium in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).c. The Thin-Ergy Jr. label declares “chromium picolinate.” The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from"" (e.g., ""Calcium (as calcium carbonate)""), in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d). The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient (e.g., the weight of calcium rather than that of calcium carbonate) [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)].d. The Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin label declares the amount of potassium that is less than 2% of the Daily Value. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).e. The Advanced Formula BioAnti-Oxidant, Advanced BioEnzymes, and Thin-Ergy AM labels fail to indent each of the component dietary ingredients under the proprietary blend dietary ingredients in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).f. Your Ancient Sea Mineral Complex, Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin, Prostate Formula, and Thin-Ergy AM products’ Supplement Facts labels fail to place a heavy bar between the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients as required by 21 CFR  101.36(e)(6)(ii).g. The Inner Cellular Energy Multi Vitamin label fails to list Ginkgo biloba with the other (b)(3)-dietary ingredients.
7. Your Thin-Ergy AM and Thin-Ergy Boost products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example, the labels fail to declare the specific part of certain plants that use the term “aerial parts.”
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, we also offer the following comment regarding your labeling:
We note that you include a nutrient content claim about beta-carotene on your product labeling. Your Pure Chlorella product label bears the statement, “It contains unusually large amounts of . . . beta-carotene . . ..“ FDA has not defined the term “unusually large amounts of. . . beta-carotene;” however, under 21 CFR 101.54(b), the terms “high,” “rich in,” or “excellent source of” may be used to characterize the level of a nutrient on the label and in the labeling of foods provided that the food contains 20 percent or more of the Daily Reference Value (DRV) per reference amount customarily consumed (RACC). Furthermore, under 21 CFR 101.54(c), the terms “good source,” “contains,” or “provides” may be used on the label provided that the food contains 10 to 19 percent of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) or Daily Reference Value (DRV) per RACC.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection related costs mean all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.

WARNING LETTER
Date:   October 15, 2020
RE:      Unapproved, Adulterated, and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.lvwell.com on various dates since August 5, 2020. We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/lvwellnessaesthetics/,where you direct consumers to your website, www.lvwell.com,to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that you offer products for sale in the United States that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1]in people.
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval, clearance, or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved, uncleared, and unauthorized products for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
COVID-19 Antibody Test Kit Product
FDA observed that your website, www.lvwell.com,offers a serology test for at-home testing, specifically the “COVID-19 ANTIBODY TEST KIT” (referred to hereafter as “COVID-19 Test Kit”).  Based on our review, your COVID-19 Test Kit is intended for use in the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis or cure of COVID-19 in people, and thus, it is a device under section 201(h) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(h).
The COVID-19 Test Kit is offered for sale and distributed in the United States directly to consumers for at-home use without marketing approval, clearance, or authorization from FDA.[4]Accordingly, your product is adulterated under section 501(f)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 351(f)(1)(B), because your firm does not have an approved application for premarket approval (PMA) in effect pursuant to section 515(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360e(a), or an approved application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) under section 520(g) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360j(g). Your product is also misbranded under section 502(o) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(o), becauseyour firm did not notify the agency of its intent to introduce the device into commercial distribution, as required by section 510(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360(k). The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a device while the device is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the device being misbranded.
We remind you that, to date, FDA has not approved, cleared, or authorized any COVID-19 serology test for at-home testing. Different and potentially serious public health risks are presented with testing in the home versus a healthcare setting. Such risks include, but are not limited to, whether a lay person has the ability to collect their specimen, run the test, and interpret the test result accurately. Your website, www.lvwell.com, indicates that the COVID-19 Test Kitmay be purchased directly by consumers and is intended to be used for at-home testing for COVID-19, including:

ViraFend Multi-Virus Defense Product
FDA also observed that your websitewww.lvwell.comoffers the ViraFend Multi-Virus Defense product for sale in the United States and that this product is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. Based on our review, the ViraFend Multi-Virus Defense product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of section 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, this product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
Some examples of the claims on your website,www.lvwell.com, that establish the intended use of your product and misleadingly represent it as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
From your webpage titled “DR. HOGAN’S TIPS DURING COVID-19” (www.lvwell.com/dr-hogans-tips-during-covid-19/): “WAYS TO FIGHT OFF VIRUSES: . . . The ViraFend Multi Virus Defense Formula [hyperlinks towww.lvwell.com/virafend-multi-virus-defense-formula]”
The “COVID-19” tab on your website provides a dropdown menu that includes the option “SUPPLEMENT SHOP,” which includes the dropdown menu option “VIRAFEND | SUPER IMMUNE BOOSTER.”  This menu option directs consumers to your webpage “VIRAFEND MULTI-VIRUS DEFENSE” (www.lvwell.com/virafend-multi-virus-defense-formula), which includes the following claims:
“FIGHT OFF VIRUSES”
“VIRAFEND® - MULTI-VIRUS DEFENSE  SUPPLEMENT
ViraFend is a daily dietary supplement that is a scientifically validated Virus Attachment Inhibitor and Virus Reproduction Regulator.”
“WHY DOES DR. HOGAN LOVE THIS PRODUCT?
After our extensive research on the ingredients contained within ViraFend, we feel this is an amazing adjunct therapy for our patients to help support their immune system. The goal is to support our immune system by fighting off foreign invaders — viruses are just that. Remember, viruses require a host to not only bind to, but also replicate. Research data on both Humic Acid and L-Lysine have both shown to help inhibit virus attachment and virus replication!”
“HOW DO WE KNOW VIRAFEND WORKS?
The active ingredient in ViraFend has been extensively tested by the National Institutes of Health and it was shown to be effective against every virus it was tested against.”
“WHY ARE YOU OFFERING THIS PRODUCT?
Viralogics, the creators behind ViraFend have been around for 7 years. Given the state of our country with the current pandemic, we know the good this supplement can do and we have the scientific data that has been clinically shown by the National Institute of Health that this formula has been proven effective against every virus they tested it against.”
Please direct any inquiries to FDA regarding your ViraFendMulti-Virus Defenseproduct to:COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.
You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter.

WARNING LETTER
Date: October 23, 2020
RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.covercology.com on September 8, 2020 and September 30, 2020, respectively. We also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/Hairreau, where you direct consumers to your website, www.covercology.com, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers the product “Simple Silver” for sale in the United States and that this product is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. Based on our review, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, this product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of this product into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell a product that is intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your product and misleadingly represent it as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
“Simple Silver (Colloidal Silver) with ionic solubility technology is a dietary supplement that has ionic solubility that may supports the Immune system ability to fight off and kill nasty pathogens that can cause illnesses inside and outside the body such as: CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) . . . Ideal for dedicated health care professionals working with Covid-19 patients . . .” [from your website www.covercology.com/shop]
“Human coronaviruses can sometimes cause lower-respiratory tract illnesses such as pneumonia or bronchitis. Simple Silver is a dietary supplement that has ionic solubility that supports the Immune system in it’s ability to fight off and kill nasty pathogens that can cause illnesses inside and outside the body such as: CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) . . . Try it today! . . . link in bio” [from a February 28, 2020 post on your social media website www.facebook.com/Hairreau]
You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours, please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at http://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
If you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States.
Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the product identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such product are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an ordermay require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Mr. Cleland at202-326-3088.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Zakowski:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed the label of your product, Ready Set Food brand introduction Stage 1, and your company website at the internet address www.readysetfood.com in January, March, and April 2020 where you take orders for the “Ready, Set, Food!” dietary supplement products. Based on our review, we have found serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act). You may find links to the Act and applicable regulations on our website,www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs
The claims on your company website, where products can be purchased, establish that the Ready Set Food! brand products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the Act.Examples of some of the claims observed on your website that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
Website, www.readysetfood.com:

Your Ready Set Food brand products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, your Ready Set Food brand products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C.§ 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data submitted by a drug sponsor to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective.
Misbranded Dietary Supplement
Even if your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product was not an unapproved new drug as noted above, our review of the product label and labeling reveal that it is a misbranded dietary supplement within the meaning of section 403 of the Act (21 U.S.C. §343) as noted below:
1. Your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(B)] because the label and labeling include unauthorized health claims. For example:a. The product label bears the unauthorized health claim: “Exposing infants to allergenic foods early and often may reduce the risk of developing food allergies by up to 80%, according to recent landmark studies.”b. The website labeling at www.readysetfood.com bears the claim “Our allergist-developed system gently introduces babies as young as four months old to peanut, egg, and milk, helping reduce their risk of developing these common food allergies by up to 80%.”c. The Pediatrician Flyer, available at www.readysetfood.com, bears the claim “Early and sustained introduction reduces the risk of food allergies by 67-80%.”
These health claims misbrand your product because they have not been authorized either by regulation [see section 343(r)(3)(A)-(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(3)(A)(B)]] or under authority of the health claim notification provision of the Act [see section 343(r)(3)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(3)(C)]]. Furthermore, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.14(e)(5), health claims are not permitted on products that are represented for infants and toddlers less than 2 years of age unless the claim is specifically provided for in a regulation. According to the label, this product is intended for infants “4+months.”
We also note that FDA has not issued a Letter of Enforcement Discretion for such claims. To the extent these claims pertain to the ingestion of peanuts, they are not consistent with the claim in the Letter of Enforcement Discretion1FDA issued in response to a petition for a qualified health claim for ground peanuts and reduced risk of developing peanut allergy. The qualified health claim for which FDA stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion is limited to the use of ground peanuts in infants to reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy and is further limited to infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy. The claims on the label and labeling of your product are not specifically for reducing the risk of developing peanut allergy but are for reducing the risk of developing food allergies in general. Furthermore, the claims are directed at infants in the general population rather than infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy.
2. Your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that the outer package label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
3. Your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to declare a complete declaration of the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.7. For example, the product is comprised of unit containers held within a multiunit package; the outer package label bears the statement “15 packets” but fails to declare the net weight of each packet and the net weight of the entire package in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7(s) and 16 CFR 500.27(a) of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.
4. Your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)) in that the product does not present nutrition information on the labeling as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:
a. The Supplement Facts label declares calories, sodium, total carbohydrate, and protein with amounts of zero or that can be declared as zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).b. The Supplement Facts label bears incorrect % Daily Values for protein based on the Daily Protein Amounts information stated on the package insert. % Daily Value must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii) and 21 CFR 101.9(c)(7).c. The Supplement Facts label declares the serving size with an amount that is a range of values rather than the weight of each of the different packets. Serving Size must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1) and 21 CFR 101.9(b)(7).d. The Supplement Facts label lists sodium and potassium in the wrong order. Sodium and potassium, their quantitative amounts by weight per serving, and percent of the daily values should be listed after calcium in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
5. Your Ready Set Food brand Introduction Stage 1 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because the inner packet labels do not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm comply with the Act and its implementing regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter.

1In 2017, after conducting a systematic review of the available scientific evidence, the FDA determined that it intended to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of a qualified health claim for infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy characterizing the relationship between the consumption of foods containing ground peanuts beginning between 4 and 10 months of age and a reduced risk of developing peanut allergy by 5 years of age.
The Letter of Enforcement Discretion was issued and announced in a Constituent Update on September 7, 2017,https://www.fda.gov/food/cfsan-constituent-updates/fda-acknowledges-qualified-health-claim-linking-early-peanut-introduction-and-reduced-risk. The claim for which FDA stated its intent to exercise enforcement discretion reads:
For most infants with severe eczema and/or egg allergy who are already eating solid foods, introducing foods containing ground peanuts between 4 and 10 months of age and continuing consumption may reduce the risk of developing peanut allergy by 5 years of age. FDA has determined, however, that the evidence supporting this claim is limited to one study.
If your infant has severe eczema and/or egg allergy, check with your infant’s healthcare provider before feeding foods containing ground peanuts.
The Letter of Enforcement Discretion was in response to a petition from Assured Bites, Inc., for a qualified health claim linking early introduction of peanuts to reduced risk of developing peanut allergy. Qualified health claims are not the same as “authorized health claims,” which must be supported by significant scientific agreement among experts in the field. Qualified health claims are supported by credible scientific evidence, but do not meet the more rigorous “significant scientific agreement” standard required for an authorized health claim. As such, they are accompanied by qualifying language or a disclaimer so that the level of scientific evidence supporting the claim is accurately communicated. The FDA’s intent to exercise enforcement discretion for the use of the qualified health claim means that the agency does not intend to object to its use as long as the claim, the products and their labels and labeling are consistent with all of the factors FDA has stated in the Letter of Enforcement Discretion.

Dear Mr. Kravitz and Mr. Coury:
This letter concerns your product pH Balancer Plus, which is labeled as a dietary supplement.  Your product labeling declares cesium chloride as a dietary ingredient in pH Balancer Plus.
The term “dietary supplement” is defined in section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)].  Cesium chloride is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(B)].  Cesium chloride is also a “new dietary ingredient” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that cesium chloride was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered.  As such, cesium chloride is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6.  Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)].troduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that cesium chloride will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient.  Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing cesium chloride would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act[21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)].  In fact, animal research has shown that taking cesium chloride can cause irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. Furthermore, there have been reports of humans experiencing serious heart problems after taking cesium chloride. Cesium chloride is associated with a lower blood level of potassium, which is a mineral that is essential to normal heart function.

Dear Mr. Brunson and Ms. Hasalone:
This letter concerns your product Cesium Plus, which is labeled as a dietary supplement. Your product labeling declares cesium chloride as a dietary ingredient in Cesium Plus.
The term “dietary supplement” is defined in section 201(ff) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. Cesium chloride is a “dietary ingredient” under section 201(ff)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)(B)]. Cesium chloride is also a “new dietary ingredient” (i.e., a dietary ingredient not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) under section 413(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(d)].
Under section 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)], a dietary supplement that contains a new dietary ingredient shall be deemed adulterated under section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] unless it meets one of two requirements:
1. The dietary supplement contains only dietary ingredients that have been present in the food supply as an article used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered; or
2. There is a history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that the dietary ingredient when used under the conditions recommended or suggested in the labeling of the dietary supplement will reasonably be expected to be safe and, at least 75 days before being introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, the manufacturer or distributor of the dietary ingredient or dietary supplement provides FDA with information, including any citation to published articles, which is the basis on which the manufacturer or distributor has concluded that a dietary supplement containing such dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe.
To the best of FDA’s knowledge, there is no information demonstrating that cesium chloride was lawfully marketed as a dietary ingredient in the United States before October 15, 1994, nor is there information demonstrating that this ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for human food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered. As such, cesium chloride is subject to the notification requirement in section 413(a)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 350b(a)(2)] and 21 CFR 190.6. Products for which the manufacturer or distributor is required to submit a new dietary ingredient notification under section 413(a)(2) and 21 CFR 190.6, but for which the required notification has not been submitted, are adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. Introduction of such products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (v) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (v)].
Moreover, based on our evaluation of the relevant safety evidence, there is no history of use or other evidence of safety establishing that cesium chloride will reasonably be expected to be safe when used as a dietary ingredient. Therefore, even if a new dietary ingredient notification had been submitted, dietary supplements containing cesium chloride would be adulterated under sections 402(f) and 413(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 342(f) and 350b(a)]. In fact, animal research has shown that taking cesium chloride can cause irregular heartbeats, also called arrhythmias. Furthermore, there have been reports of humans experiencing serious heart problems after taking cesium chloride. Cesium chloride is associated with a lower blood level of potassium, which is a mineral that is essential to normal heart function. In the absence of adequate information to provide reasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury, dietary supplements containing cesium chloride are adulterated under section 402(f)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(B)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violation in this letter, as well as any other violations associated with your Cesium Plus product or other dietary supplement products marketed by your firm, including any that contain cesium chloride. We also remind you that the new dietary ingredient notification requirement applies to all dietary supplements that contain new dietary ingredients that have not been present in the food supply as articles used for food in a form in which the food has not been chemically altered.

Dear Dr. Robbins:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses https://my4hfl.com and https://drsamrobbins.com in June 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for your products AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax, as well as your websites https://www.inflamepainrelief.com, https://alphaviril.com, and https://healthfitnesslongevity.com where you take orders for these products.
We also reviewed your social media websites at https://www.facebook.com/DrSamRobbins/, https://twitter.com/drsamrobbins, https://www.instagram.com/drsamrobbsin/, www.youtube.com/user/drsamrobbins/, and www.youtube.com/channel/UCwu7T1j1JvRcpYAFg5SEixQ/, which contain links to your websites at https://drsamrobbsin.com, https://my.4hfl.com, and/or https://healthfitnesslongevity.com. Additionally, we reviewed product listings on your Amazon storefront at https://www.amazon.com/s?i=merchant-items&me=A3S4W2SM9FX1BR, which you operate under the name, HFL - Dr Sam Robbins Official Store.
Although you label and promote CholesLo as a dietary supplement, laboratory analyses of two samples collected by the FDA determined that this product contains lovastatin. Lovastatin is the active ingredient in Mevacor® and its generic counterparts, which are FDA-approved drugs used to treat patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The first sample contained approximately 14.3 mg per capsule. If taken at the maximum dose recommended on the label, your product would provide 85.8 mg lovastatin per day, which is above the maximum recommended daily dose of lovastatin in Mevacor and its generic counterparts. The second sample contained approximately 0.4141 mg per capsule. If taken at the maximum dose recommended on the label, your product would provide 2.48 mg lovastatin per day, which is less than half the recommended daily dose of lovastatin in Mevacor and its generic counterparts.
FDA has issued a warning to consumers not to use “CholesLo” (see the “CholesLo” Immediate Public Notification) as a result of the lab analyses finding lovastatin in your products.
Traditional red yeast rice does not contain more than trace amounts of lovastatin, if any. Because your CholesLo product contains red yeast rice with enhanced or added lovastatin, it cannot be marketed as a dietary supplement. Section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)] specifically excludes from the dietary supplement definition articles that are approved as new drugs under section 505, unless the article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a new drug. FDA approved Mevacor® as a new drug on August 31, 1987; neither lovastatin as a single ingredient, nor any red yeast rice product manufactured and promoted for lovastatin content, was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before that date. FDA’s conclusions that lovastatin’s approval as a new drug preceded its marketing as a food or dietary supplement and that a lovastatin-enhanced red yeast rice product is not a dietary supplement were upheld in litigation involving a product called Cholestin.Pharmanex, Inc. v. Shalala, 221 F.3d 1151 (10th Cir. 2000); 2001 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4598 (D. Utah Mar. 30, 2001) (district court opinion on remand).
In addition to analyzing your products, we have reviewed your websites, including your social media websites, and Amazon storefront webpage as noted in the beginning of this letter, and have determined that claims on your labels and websites establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) and 201(g)(1)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 321(g)(1)(B) and 321(g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease or to affect the structure or function of the human body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
CholesLo
Examples of some of the website and product label claims that provide evidence that your CholesLo product is intended for use as a drug include:
On your product label of CholesLo:• “Promotes Healthy Cholesterol Levels”• “Supports Balanced HDL/LDL Ratios”• “WHY CholesLo™ Is Better? . . . One of the primary causes of high cholesterol, is the change in your hormones due to aging. CholesLo™ is our best solution on the market”
On your website https://my.4hfl.com/choleslo:• In your video embedded on the webpage,o “NATURALLY improve your cholesterol levels fromwithin. . . The ingredients in CholesLo™ are clinically proven… to help… 1. Create healthy cholesterol levels. 2. Optimize your HDL/LDL ratios…. 4. [R]epair your LIVER… 6. Naturally lower blood sugar levels and total-body ‘inflammation’.”o “CholesLo™ . . . it’s a COMPLETE solution that focuses on ALL the potential… …causes of heart disease”o “In fact, if CholesLo™ doesn’t help lower your total cholesterol by30 pts in only 30 days. . . I’ll give you a full refund . . . I can make such a guarantee . . . because I’ve seen CholesLo™ work for over 12 years”• “Most likely you’re reading this because you’re interested in improving your cholesterol and lipid levels naturally . . . CholesLo’s 20+ year proven formula can help you achieve healthy cholesterol and balanced lipid levels.”• “CholesLo™ also helps reduce inflammation – a major leading factor of many health problems, which can cause a heart attack or stroke.”• “The reason I formulated CholesLo™ in 1998 for my parents, was because they were having too many negative side-effects from their prescription, cholesterol lowering ‘statin’ drugs.”
On your website https://www.choleslo.drsamrobbins.com/sub/research.php:• You provide a chart titled, “CholesLo’s Average 30-Day Improvements,” and several graphs including, “Average Cholesterol Improved In 8 Weeks = 46 pts (19%),” “Randomized Double-Blind Study Average Percentage (%) Of Lipids Improved in 20 Weeks,” and “Average LDL Improved in 21 Days = 8.9%,” which indicate that your product is intended for use in lowering cholesterol levels.
On your website https://www.choleslo.drsamrobbins.com/sub/ingredients.php:• “‘The combination of red yeast rice extract and policosanols [ingredients in your product CholesLo] is both safe and effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolomic children . . . significantly reduce cholesterolemia and achieved acceptable plasma LDL-C levels in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients.’”• “If you have high LDL cholesterol levels, garlic [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] supplementation is especially important because LDL cholesterol oxidation causes atherosclerosis . . . Most importantly, garlic prevents abnormal platelet aggregation (thrombosis) via several different mechanisms. The formation of arterial blood clots is the primary cause of most heart attacks and strokes.”• “The discovery that artichoke leaf extract [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] reduces elevated cholesterol levels opens up exciting perspectives in the prevention and treatment of arteriosclerosis and coronary heart disease.”• “Because of their ability to block dietary cholesterol absorption, phytosterols [an ingredient in your product CholesLo] can help lower your cholesterol levels. In the last few years, clinical research has also discovered other effects, including reducing symptoms of an enlarged prostate, improving the control of blood sugar among people with diabetes, and reducing inflammation among patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus.”
We also reviewed your websites and determined that you take orders there for AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax, which your websites promote for conditions that cause the products to be drugs under sections 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)]. The claims on your websites establish that these products are drugs because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Inflame & Pain Relief

We would recommend this product to everyone for high cholesterol.”• “My son-in-law takes it [Provanax] also, for ADHD.”
When scientific references are used commercially by the seller of a product to promote the product to consumers, such references may become evidence of the product’s intended use. For example, under 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(iv)(C), a citation of a publication or reference in the labeling of a dietary supplement is considered to be a claim about disease treatment or prevention if the citation refers to a disease use, and if, in the context of the labeling as a whole, the citation implies treatment or prevention of a disease. Your websites provide the following publications reporting the results of studies pertaining to the use of CholesLo and its ingredients for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular diseases:

On an October 28, 2019 YouTube video titled, “WARNING: Prostate cancer is linked to LOW testosterone!

Furthermore, you operate an Amazon storefront under the name, HFL - Dr Sam Robbins Official Store. We reviewed your product listings for Blood Flow Optimizer, CHEATmeals, and LeanOptimizer. The product descriptions on these listings provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
On the Blood Flow Optimizer webpage, https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/EF3755F8-FFDE-4688-B985-BCC411AB8C1A:• “Nattokinase [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] is by nature a blood thinner”• “Ginger [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] boasts anti-inflammatory properties that position it as an effective substitute for aspirin. Well documented for helping to prevent blood clots, its [sic] also been known to fight against atherosclerosis which can ultimately help to reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke.”• “Green Tea Extract [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] . . . linked to managing blood pressure”• “White Willow Extract [an ingredient in your Blood Flow Optimizer product] contains salicin, a natural blood thinner and anti-inflammatory.”• “Aging causes poor blood flow to the brain, which means less oxygen resulting in memory & cognitive problems, even Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s. The good news is that you can now reverse this ‘aging problem’, naturally.”
On the Blood Flow Optimizer product listing:• “Decrease the plaque buildup”• “Strengthen the walls of the arteries and blood vessels, reducing the chance of a rupture or tear.”• “Inhibit future buildup of plaque and calcium, which can help prevent a heart attack or stroke.”
On the CHEATmeals product listing:• “Lower Bad Cholesterol, LDL and Triglycerides”• “Normalize Blood Sugar and Glucose Levels”
On the LeanOptimizer product listing:• “Helps lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels”
Your AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, AlphaViril, Blood Flow Optimizer, Blood Pressure Optimizer, Blood Sugar Optimizer, CHEATmeals, CholesLo, Inflame & Pain Relief, LeanOptimizer, Perfect Vitamin D & K, and ProVanax fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)].The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].

WL # 597677
Dear Dr. Lin:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility, Essential Pharmaceutical Corp, located at 1906 W. Holt Ave, Pomona, CA, on October 8-10 and 17, 2019. Based on the inspectional findings and a subsequent review of your product labels collected during the inspection, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drug
Your firm manufactures and distributes “BIO-MINT Nasal Spray,” which is an unapproved new drug and is being marketed as a nonprescription, over-the-counter (OTC) drug product. Introduction or delivery for introduction of such product into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). This product is also misbranded under section 502(ee) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), and its introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited by section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a). These violations are described in more detail below.
“BIO-MINT Nasal Spray” is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because it is intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and/or under section 201(g)(1)(C) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(C), because it is intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. Specifically, this product is intended for use as a combination nasal decongestant, antihistamine, and antiseptic.Examples of claims observed on the product label that provide evidence of the intended uses (as defined in 21 CFR 201.128) of the product include, but may not be limited to, the following:
• “Nasal Decongestant Antihistamine Antiseptic . . .● Allergies ● Colds ● Hay Fever ● Sinusitis . . . For prompt, temporary relief of nasal congestion due to colds, sinusitis hay fever, allergies and runny nose.”
For the reasons explained below, BIO MINT Nasal Spray is also a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p), and requires an approved new drug application under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, in order to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce.
A drug that is not generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). We are unaware of any adequate and well-controlled clinical studies in the published literature that support a determination that BIO-MINT Nasal Spray is GRASE for use under the conditions suggested, recommended, or prescribed in its labeling, including the above-described intended uses; absent this evidence, the product is not GRASE. Nor is the new drug status of BIO-MINT Nasal Spray altered by section 505G of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355h,1because the product does not satisfy the conditions under 505G(a)(1) of the Act that would make it a drug deemed to be GRASE and not a ""new drug"".
According to its labeling, “BIO-MINT Nasal Spray” is a drug for topical (nasal) administration that contains as active ingredients the nasal decongestant phenylephrine HCL, the antihistamine pyrilamine maleate, and the antiseptic benzalkonium chloride. This drug does not satisfy the requirements of either section 505G(a)(1)(A) or section 505G(a)(1)(B) of the Act.
Under section 505G(a)(1)(A) of the Act, in order for a nonprescription drug to be deemed to be GRASE and not a new drug, it must be in conformity with the requirements of a final monograph issued under 21 CFR part 330 and other applicable requirements. Although FDA issued a final monograph under 21 CFR part 330 for Cold, Cough, Allergy, Bronchodilator, and Antiasthmatic Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use that provides requirements for nonprescription topical nasal decongestant and antihistamine drug products (see 21 CFR Part 341),2BIO-MINT Nasal Spray is not in conformity with these requirements because that final monograph does not permit the combination of an antihistamine active ingredient with a nasal decongestant active ingredient in a topical dosage form. Similarly, the final monograph does not permit the combination of a nasal decongestant active ingredient with an antiseptic active ingredient such as benzalkonium chloride. (See 21 CFR 341.40).
Nor is BIO-MINT Nasal Spray deemed to be GRASE and not a new drug under 505G(a)(1)(B) of the Act, which accords that status to a drug that is classified in category I for safety and effectiveness under a tentative final monograph that is the most recently applicable proposal or determination issued under 21 CFR part 330, if that drug is in conformity with the proposed requirements for nonprescription use of such tentative final monograph and any applicable subsequent determination by the Secretary, and conforms with other applicable requirements. Although nonprescription drug products that contain benzalkonium chloride and that are intended for use as topical antiseptics were addressed in the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for OTC Topical Antimicrobial Products, 43 FR 1210 (January 6, 1978) (amended at 56 FR 33644 (July 22, 1991) (addressing first aid antiseptics) and 59 FR 31402 (June 17, 1994), 78 FR 76444 (December 17, 2013), 80 FR 25166 (May 1, 2015), and 81 FR 42912 (June 30, 2016) (addressing consumer and health care antiseptics)), these documents do not classify into category I any drug that includes the combination of an antiseptic, an antihistamine, and a nasal decongestant active ingredient.
For the foregoing reasons, “BIO-MINT Nasal Spray” is a new drug within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p) and it may not be legally marketed in the United States absent approval of an application filed in accordance with section 505(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a).3“BIO-MINT Nasal Spray” is not the subject of an FDA-approved application, and its introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). In addition, because “BIO-Mint Nasal Spray” is a nonprescription drug that is subject to section 505G of the Act, is not the subject of an application approved under section 505 of the Act, and does not comply with the requirements under section 505G of the Act, it is misbranded under section 502(ee) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(ee), and its introduction into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the products you manufacture to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You failed to establish specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b). Specifically,
a. You failed to establish identity specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1).b. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2).c. You failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3).
For example, you failed to establish specifications for the following components:
a. D‐Biotin Lot(b)(4)component for Vicare brand DiabeCare Lot(b)(4)productb. Bitter Melon Extract Lot(b)(4)component for Vicare brand DiabeCare Lot(b)(4)productc. Suprarenal Substance Lot(b)(4)component for Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4)productd. Radix Notoginseng (no lot #) component for GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold Lot(b)(4)producte. Bee Pollen Powder Lot(b)(4)component for Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4)productf. Placenta Substance Lot(b)(4)component for Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4)productg. Ascorbic Acid Lot(b)(4)component for Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4)product
Once you have established component specifications and before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2).
We acknowledge that you have established specifications for microbiological contaminants for your dietary ingredients and other ingredient components. During the inspection, you stated that your microbiological contaminants specifications are your identity specifications. These specifications are not considered identity specifications. They would be considered to be a type of contamination specification only. In addition, while you established specifications for microbial contaminants for your dietary ingredients and other ingredient components, you failed to establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, for example specifications for heavy metal contamination.
Further, you have been conducting testing on some of your incoming ingredients using FTIR. However, you have not established an identity specification to ensure that the results are evaluated against a valid standard. Your FTIR testing compares the in-coming component to previously received lots of the component. The previously received lots have not been qualified as reference standards.2. You failed to establish product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you list “(b)(4)” as the specification for your finished products. “(b)(4)” is not a finished product specification; it is an in-process control. For example, the following products list “(b)(4)” as a finished product specification:
• Vicare brand DiabeCare• Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support• GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold
Once you have established the appropriate specifications you must determine whether the specifications are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75.
3. You failed to establish specifications for dietary supplement labels, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). Specifically, you receive and apply labels for some of the products that you contract manufacture, including Vicare brand DiabeCare, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support, and GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold. You have not established label specifications with which to compare incoming labels.
4. You failed to establish and follow all required written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting reprocessing as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, you have not established written procedures for the responsibilities of your quality control operations for the following:
a. Your quality control(b)(4)did not ensure that the dietary supplement is labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Specifically, your quality control(b)(4)conducted a material review and made a disposition decision to ensure that the finished dietary supplement Vicare brand DiabeCare, lot(b)(4)was labeled per Master Manufacturing Record; however, ingredients included in the MMR and in the BPR were not all listed on the label.b. Your quality control(b)(4)did not approve or reject processes, specifications, written procedures, controls, tests, examinations and deviations or modifications that may affect the identity, purity, strength, or composition of a dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Specifically, your quality control(b)(4)are not conducting and documenting the following required quality control operations:
1) A material review and disposition decision of the microbiology analysis conducted for components and finished dietary supplements.2) A material review and disposition decision of reject, rework, or approve for components prior to use.3) Documentation of a disposition decision of each finished dietary supplement batch, including all batch‐related records. Quality Control personnel only document that the batch production record has been reviewed. An example of such finished product is Vicare brand DiabeCare Lot(b)(4).4) A material review, then signature and date upon implementation of all written procedures. You do not have a written procedure for quality control operations, holding and distribution operations, receiving operations, handling returned dietary supplements, equipment maintenance, quarantine system, production and process control operations, and packaging and labeling operations. Examples of unapproved written procedures are your(b)(4)SOP,(b)(4)SOP, and your(b)(4)SOP.
c. Your quality control(b)(4)did not reject a dietary supplement when an established microbiological specification was not met as required by 21 CFR 111.113(b)(2). Specifically, your quality control(b)(4)do not reject a finished dietary supplement batch when microbiological specifications are not met. For example, your dietary supplement GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold Lot(b)(4)did not meet established specifications for Total Aerobic Count (TAC), Yeast & Mold, Enterobacteria, and E. coli. You distributed the finished dietary supplement batch to your customer on 01/22/19 and 02/08/19.d. Your quality control operations did not include approving or rejecting reprocessing when a microbiological specification was not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.123(a)(5). Specifically, your quality control(b)(4)do not conduct and document a material review and disposition decision approving or rejecting the reconditioning treatment conducted for dietary ingredients and finished dietary supplements that do not meet established microbiology specifications. For example, your dietary ingredient Bee Pollen Powder Lot(b)(4)(used to make the dietary supplement Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4)) and your dietary supplement product GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold Lot(b)(4)did not meet established specifications for Total Aerobic Count (TAC) and Staphylococcus Aureus. In both cases, you told the investigator that you(b)(4).
5. You failed to prepare a Master Manufacturing Records (MMRs) that includes the information specified in 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your MMRs for the dietary supplement products you contract manufacture, including Vicare brand DiabeCare, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support, and GC Natural brand CSDP Gold, do not include the following:
a. A complete list of components to be used as required by 21 CFR 111.210(b). Specifically, our inspector identified handwritten formulation adjustments that are documented on the batch production record to include components not listed in the MMR formulation.b. An accurate weight or measure for each component as required by 21 CFR 111.210(c). Specifically, our inspector identified handwritten formulation adjustments are documented on the batch production record to add a component and component amount as well as to change an existing component strength or amount not listed in the MMR.c. A statement of the theoretical yield for each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process to ensure quality control or the expected yield of the finished dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.210(f).d. A description of packaging and a representative label or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g).e. Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1). Your MMRs lack written instructions for time required for blending.f. Procedures for sampling as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(2). Your MMRs lack written instructions for in-process testing frequency and for the amount of product to be collected by Quality Control for sampling.g. Written instructions for one person adding a component and another person verifying the addition of the component as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B).h. Corrective action plans for use when each specification is not met as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5).
6. You failed to prepare a batch production record every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplements with the information required by 21 CFR 111.255(b). Specifically, your batch production records for Vicare brand DiabeCare Lot(b)(4), Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Support Lot(b)(4), and GC Natural brand CSDP Gold Lot(b)(4), do not include the following required information:
a. The actual weight or measure of each component used (21 CFR 111.260(e)).b. The time of cleaning and sanitizing of each piece of equipment (21 CFR 111.260(c)).c. The unique identifier that you assign to each packaging component and label used (21 CFR 111.260(d)).d. A statement of actual yield obtained at appropriate phases of processing, such as after blending and after encapsulation (21 CFR 111.260(f)).e. The initials of the person verifying the weight of each component (21 CFR 111.260(j)(2)(ii)).f. An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label for the finished dietary supplement for all batches (21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)).
We note that you document the equipment used in the BPR. However, as you have multiple pieces of equipment with the same identification in different rooms, documenting the room in which the processing takes place would clarify which of the same named equipment was used.
7. You did not maintain, clean and sanitize equipment, and contact surfaces used to manufacture or hold components or dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 111.27(d). Specifically,
a. Per your undated(b)(4)SOP, the(b)(4)machines are to be partially disassembled and cleaned with water and Isopropyl Alcohol. Any machine thus cleaned are to be recleaned if not used within three (3) days.(b)(4)Machine 3 located in(b)(4)Room 1 was observed to have chipped paint and a yellow powder buildup. This Machine was verbally identified as being cleaned and ready for use.b. Blender 2 was observed to be stored with yellow powder build up from a previous use of the machine and had just had a product that was off-white blenblended in it. Further, the corners and top surface of the machine are not smooth or easily cleanable.c. Additionally, several of the(b)(4)machines located in(b)(4)Room 1 were identified as not being able to be disassembled for cleaning. Further, our investigators were told that it takes approximately(b)(4)hours to completely disassemble and clean a(b)(4)machine but that only(b)(4)minutes are allotted for cleaning between products(b)(4)through(b)(4)and(b)(4)minutes on(b)(4). We were advised that the(b)(4)-minute cleaning allowed for a blow down of equipment followed by a wipe with water and finally a spray with isopropyl alcohol.d. Finally, several of the(b)(4)machines located in(b)(4)Room 1 had tape, rope/twine, and cardboard, etc. affixed to the machines. These materials are not easily cleanable.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
The dietary supplement products discussed below are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 [21 U.S.C. § 343] of the Act and/or fail to comply with the regulations implementing the food labeling requirements of the Act, which are found in 21 CFR Part 101.
1. Your products, Vicare brand DiabeCare, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, and GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold, are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the product label fails to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
a. Vicare brand DiabeCare, lot(b)(4), was manufactured using the components Potassium Sorbate and Lodex-10, but the label fails to list the common or usual names of these components. Furthermore, the label declares the ingredients gelatin and microcrystalline cellulose, but these ingredients do not appear on the batch record for lot(b)(4). Lastly, the Gymnema Sylvestre extract listed on the label is “(b)(4)%” and the Gymnema Sylvestre used to manufacture the lot is “(b)(4)%.”b. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product label declares the dietary ingredient banaba. This botanical is not listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce; therefore, the product label must state the Latin binomial name of the plant in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(h)(2).c. Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, lot(b)(4), was manufactured using the components Krafen, DCP unmilled, Sipernate-22, Sodium Croscarmellose, Folic Acid, Vitamin B-12, and Fumarate, but the label fails to list the common or usual names of these components. Furthermore, the label fails to state the source of the glandular materials.d. GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold, lot(b)(4), was manufactured with Magnesium Stearate, Tixosil-38A and Potassium Sorbate, but the label fails to list the common or usual names of these components.
2. Your product, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, lot(b)(4), is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the product is falsely labeled to contain Lymph Tissue and Bone Marrow but, according to the BPR, these components were not included during manufacture.
3. Your product, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that the label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
4. Your products, Vicare brand DiabeCare and Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2.a. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product’s Supplement Facts label indicates a serving size of 2 capsules; however, the “Suggested Usage” states “take one capsule after each meal.” The serving size should be 1 capsule.b. The Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost product’s Supplement Facts label indicates a serving size of 2 capsules; however, the “Directions” state “… 2-6 tablets per day ….” The serving size should be 6 tablets.
5. Your products, Vicare brand DiabeCare and Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example: Bitter Melon Extract, Banaba Extract, etc. in Vicare brand DiabeCare; and Goldenseal, Echinacea, etc. in Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost.
6. Your product, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
7. Your products, Vicare brand DiabeCare, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, and GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold, are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the products do not present nutrition information on the labeling as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:
a. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product label fails to declare the dietary ingredients contained in the proprietary blend in descending order of predominance by weight, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(2).b. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product label declares chromium polynicotinate. The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient (e.g., the weight of chromium rather than that of chromium polynicotinate) [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)]. The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from"", e.g., ""Chromium (as chromium polynicotinate)"" [21 CFR 101.36(d)].c. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product label declares Biotin (B7) whereas B7 is not the nomenclature or synonym specified for biotin in 21 CFR 101.9 or 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B). Furthermore, the label fails to declare the % Daily Value for biotin as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii).d. The Vicare brand DiabeCare product label fails to declare the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and “other dietary ingredients” in the order and format prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36. The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients must be listed in the order prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) followed by a heavy bar and then “other dietary ingredients”.e. The GC Naturals brand CSDP Gold product label fails to place the subheading ""Serving Size"" under the heading ""Supplement Facts"" and fails to place the subheading ""Servings Per Container"" shall be placed under the subheading ""Serving Size"" in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i) and 101.36(b)(1)(ii). Furthermore, the label fails to place the dietary ingredient name on the same line as its quantitative amount per serving and % Daily Value.f. The Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost product label fails to declare the source of pantothenic acid. The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from."" When a source ingredient is not identified within the nutrition label, it shall be listed in an ingredient statement in accordance with 101.4(g) [21 CFR 101.36(d)].g. The Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost product label fails to place light and heavy bars is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e).
8. Your product, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, is misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(q)(5)(F) and 403(s)(2)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 343(q)(5)(F) and 343(s)(2)(A)] in that the label fails to list the name of each ingredient of the dietary supplement product that is described in section 201(ff) and the quantity of each such ingredient. For example, the product label contains ingredient information to suggest that the product contains goldenseal, echinacea, and garlic. The Supplement Facts label fails to declare these dietary ingredients and the quantitative amount by weight per serving of each as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).
9. Your product, Vicare brand DiabeCare, is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §343(f)] because the product label contains information in two languages, but it does not repeat all the required information in both languages. As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
10. Your product, Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost, is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] because the label declares the source of vitamin A as “fish liver oil” but fails to identify the species of fish allergen source.
Section 201(qq) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(qq), defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients [section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen) [section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, the Lakeway Essentials brand Immune Boost product label does not declare the specific type of fish present in the product. A declaration of the “species” of fish for purposes of complying with Section 403(w)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)] should be made using the acceptable market name provided in FDA's The Seafood List. We note, however, that if a “Contains” statement is used to declare the source of the fish we would not object to just the type of fish being used, e.g., “Contains trout.”

Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover the FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, the FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.

August 25, 2020
RE: 608749
Dear Mr. Manzo:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.opi-cure.com in June 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for the product “Opi-Cure.” The claims on your website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
On the image of your product label:
The name of your product, “Opi-Cure”
“Relieves withdrawal symptoms associated with opiate abuse”
On your home page:
“Opi-Cure is a unique supplement that contains root bark of the voacanga magnitola (voacanga africana) tree that contains the alkaloids voacangine and voaccamine which has been shown to be effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with opiate dependence.”

“REAL WITHDRAWAL RELIEF Opi-Cure will help eliminate or reduce the severe, sometimes flu-like, symptoms that are known as Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (OWS).”
“WHAT IS OPIOID WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME? Stopping opioid use can result in severe, sometimes flu-like, symptoms that are known as Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (OWS).”
“NO PRESCRIPTION REQUIRED Opi-Cure is considered a dietary supplement to help relieve the flu-like withdrawal symptoms so no prescription is required.”
On the product page for “Opi-Cure”:
“Opi-Cure's primarily [sic] use is as a supplement to aid the cessation of opiate or stimulant use in persons with addiction by providing relief from the severe, sometimes flu-like symptoms caused by Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (OWS). It can also be used to assist in breaking the cycle of abuse and relapse after the initial detoxifying process is complete.”
On your webpage titled “Opi-Cure Usage Strategies”:
“For those with a low to moderate opiate dependency, Opi-Cure is best suited for going cold turkey off of moderate opiate dosage. If this fits your opiate use profile, independent treatment with Opi-Cure as directed when you start feeling your withdrawal symptoms should keep the withdrawals at bay. After a few days, your withdrawal symptoms should start to subside and you can gradually reduce Opi-Cure dosages and frequency.”
“For those with a high opiate dependency and history, Opi-Cure is best used for a week or two to lower that dependency. For example, this can be done by skipping doses or cutting your dose in half while simultaneously using Opi-Cure to relieve the resulting withdrawals and effects of skipping or reducing a highly addictive substance. Opi-Cure will help your brain regulate to the lower dose much faster than normal.”
“Once you believe your dosage has reached a point to consider it a LOW TO MODERATE OPIATE DEPENDENCY, then you would be in a position where you could remove opiates cold turkey (as described above) and Opi-Cure would be effective. This method takes a little bit of discipline but can be adjusted to a speed you feel comfortable with.”
On your webpage titled “FAQ”:
“Opi-Cure is a unique supplement that is effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with opiate dependence.”
“Opi-Cure is for those suffering from the physical and mental dependence that addiction brings also known as Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (OWS).”
“The chemical structure of voacangine and voaccamine resembles ibogaine, found in the Iboga shrub native to Central Africa that has an ‘anti-addiction’ effect. The voacangine and voaccamine found in Opi-Cure has been proven to possess the same effects therefore, is effective in the treatment of withdrawal symptoms and cravings associated with opiate dependence.”
“Opi-Cure should be taken as soon as you start feeling your withdrawal symptoms.”
“Opi-Cure dosage varies greatly by your current opiate use and dependency. Therefore, we recommend beginning treatment with 2-3 capsules with food every 4-5 hours. For customers who need additional relief, Opi-Cure can be taken in a higher dose (4-5 capsules) and more often (every 2-3 hours) based on your own relief requirements but only AFTER initial individual response has been effectively judged. For moderate opiate/stimulant addiction, at least two bottles is recommended.”
Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product “Opi-Cure” is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, “Opi-Cure” fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE: 608903
Dear Mr. Scott
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.nutritionalsupplementscorp.com in June 2020 and has determined that you market and take orders for the products Vitadone,” “Diabrex,” and “Viadevita” from the web links on your website that direct your customers to your Amazon product pages to purchase the aforementioned products. The claims on your website and Amazon product pages establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your website, your product labels, and Amazon product pages that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Vitadone
On the product page for “Vitadone” on www.nutritionalsupplementscorp.com:
“A nutritional supplement formulated especially for methadone patients.”
“With its aggressive formulation of vital nutrients and vitamins, Vitadone effectively addresses such real world issues as bowel irregularity related to the use of Methadone. Vitadone has no Iron and thus is also appropriate for people with Hepatitis C.”
“Special dosage: two tablets with breakfast and two tablets with lunch to relieve bowel irregularity.”
On your Amazon product page for “Vitadone”:
“Vitadone, Multivitamin for Methadone Patients | Fights Fatigue, Promotes Regularity, and Helps Reduce Sugar Cravings”
“ASSISTS OPIOID ADDICTION RECOVERY: Many opioids can cause addictions. Such as heroin, hydrocodone, codeine, oxycodone, and other narcotic pain killers. Such addictions can be accompanied by side effects such as bowel irregularity, severe cramping, loss of appetite, sugar cravings, sweating, and others. Vitadone is designed to “break the blood barrier” exposing body organs to the array of vitamins and minerals, thus, enhancing normal body functions and providing energy and stamina.”
“USE WITH METHADONE TREATMENTS: Vitadone is used by people who are on a methadone treatment program. Vitadone was created specifically for opiate addicted patients on methadone. It addresses side effects from the treatment of methadone like the regularity of bowel movements, sweating, sugar cravings, and fatigue.”
“OTHER USES FOR MEN & WOMEN: While Vitadone was formulated to specifically combat the effects of methadone treatment, that’s not its only use … Vitadone can also be used by people with Hepatitis C.”
“Vitadone is commonly used by people who are on a methadone treatment program. Vitadone was created specifically for opiate addicted patients on methadone. It addresses the negative side effects associated with methadone.”
Diabrex
On the product page for “Diabrex” on www.nutritionalsupplementscorp.com:
“Diabrex is a chelated nutritional supplement to assist everyone, including those with diabetes”
“In addition, such nutrients increase the health of a patient to which they are administered. Thus, the nutrient composition and any standard drug treatment act synergistically to increase the quality of life, and life expectancy of a patient. In a related aspect, the invention features a similar method for treatment of disorders caused by diabetes by administration of a composition as described above.”
ViadevitaOn the product page for “Viadevita” on www.nutritionalsupplementscorp.com:
“For individuals with HIV/AIDS, good nutrition is essential to support overall health and strengthen the immune system. Viadevita is specially formulated to provide this vital nutritional support. In addition, this patented formula can help support the effectiveness of the antiviral and other drugs while its immune boosting nutrients help protect naturally from the toxic effects of the antiviral medications. This nutritional support, when combined with standard HIV/AIDS drug treatment, can improve the quality of life and maximize opportunity to extend life expectancy.”
“Viadevita is specially formulated to support the overall health and immune systems of individuals with HIV/AIDS … It can also support the effectiveness of antiviral drugs while simultaneously helping to protect naturally from the toxic effects of some medications.”
On your Amazon product page for “Viadevita”:
“WHAT IS HIV AND AIDS? HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system and can destroy it if left untreated. AIDS refers to a set of symptoms that occur in the final stages of an HIV infection. While there is now no known cure for HIV, proper nutritional support may help keep you healthier longer. Viadevita is a natural immune support formula that can promote a healthy immune system.”
“IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT SUPPLEMENT: Autoimmune diseases like HIV and AIDS often leave people feeling sick and make them more susceptible to infections and diseases. Viadevita is designed to be an immune system booster. This cellular support supplement is ideal for men and women alike. Support your immune system health with Viadevita.”
Your website at www.nutritionalsupplementscorp.com also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of ""Vitadone"" for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
“I recently started taking methadone to combat and control a nasty addiction habit. The nurse at the clinic suggested I take Vitadone. What a huge difference! The sugar cravings have decreased. I am eating and sleeping better, but best of all the bowel regularity is coming back.”
“I have been on methadone for six horrible years. The side effects are just pathetic. I have a wife and three kids. I work six days a week. As soon as I get home I don’t want to do nothing besides go to bed. I am tired all day long and don’t want to go anywhere. I noticed a flier in my counselor’s office for Vitadone. I heard good things about it, and looked it up on line and bought a bottle. I got it 2 days later. I took it as prescribed , 3 a day, morning, lunch, and dinner. On Sunday I actually felt refreshed and awake and I was in a pretty good mood. I have not had so much energy since I was fifteen years old. I am writing to see if you would contact my clinic. They do not sell it. If they did it would help so many more people like it did me. It gave me back my life.”
“One of the most satisfying benefits is the relief of constipation. Thank you for introducing Vitadone.”
“I have been on methadone for one year. A few months ago I tried Vitadone and within a couple of weeks I noticed my constipation had eased considerably. Prior to taking Vitadone I would wake up at night with my sheets and clothes soaked with sweat. Since using Vitadone, I no longer have this problem! What a difference. I stand on my feet most all day with my job. Since using Vitadone my stamina has increased tremendously.”
“I am writing to let you know how much Vitadone has worked for me. It helps me with my side effects. It helps keep me from falling asleep, and also helps enhance the meds I’m on.”

Refer to CMS 606456Dear Mr. Hudlow:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your product labeling for Antiiva and LungRenew following an inspection of your facility located at 4832 Park Glen Road, Minneapolis, Minnesota, between December 12 and 31, 2019. Between February and June 2020, we also reviewed your product catalog, mailers for Antiiva and LungRestore, and your social media website, https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Health---Wellness-Website/Hampshire-Labs-Inc-291271177574079/, where you direct consumers to your website, http://www.hampshirelabs.com/, to purchase your products.

As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
You can find the Act and FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.

Product catalog:• “LungRenew can help you breathe easier even if you have asthma, bronchitis, or emphysema. This all-natural cleanser relaxes, purifies and strengthens your lungs.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(p).

FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1), if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended, 21 CFR 201.5.

Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We offer the following comments regarding your compliance with the labeling regulations for dietary supplements, 21 CFR Part 101:
1. Your Hampshire Labs, Inc. brand Antiiva and Worldwide Herbals brand Holy12 product labels do not declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:a. The Hampshire Labs, Inc. brand Antiiva product label declares “Beta Sitosterol Complex” but fails to list all(b)(4)of the complex’s sub-ingredients.b. The Worldwide Herbals brand Holy12 product label declares the dietary ingredient banaba. This botanical is not listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce; therefore, the product label must state the Latin binomial name of the plant in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(h)(2).
2. Your Worldwide Herbals brand Holy12 product labels do not identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
Within 15 working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE:        Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address: http://josephhealthgroup.com on April 22, 2020 and August 6, 2010, respectively. The FDA has observed that your website offers the products Basic Immune Support Kit, Enhanced Immune Support Kit, and Ultra Immune Support Kit for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1]in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your website that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
Under the heading  “IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM JOSEPH HEALTH GROUP CONCERNING COVID-19” on the same webpage where you sell your Basic Immune Support Kit, Enhanced Immune Support Kit, and Ultra Immune Support Kit (https://order.myimmunitykit.com/josephhealthgroup37598197):

United States
Dear Ms. Tabor:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your distribution facility located at 200 Peddycord Park Court, Kernersville, NC from February 10-12, 2020.  Your firm distributes food, dietary supplement, and cosmetic products that are contract manufactured for you under your firm’s name.  During the inspection, our investigator collected product labels for your products.  Based on our inspection and subsequent review of your product labels and labeling, we have found serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations.  You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage atwww.fda.gov.
At the close of the inspection, a FDA Form 483, Inspectional Observations was issued.  We acknowledge receipt of your written response submitted on March 2, 2020.  We have reviewed your response and discuss your significant violations and your corrective actions below.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplement products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulation for dietary supplements found in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulation (CFR) Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111).  During the inspection of your facility, our investigator observed the following significant violations of CGMP requirements:
1. You failed to have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2) [see also 21 CFR 111.127(h)].  Specifically, your firm distributes the dietary supplements Multivitamin Multimineral 100 and gorgeous roses that are contract manufactured for you, but you had no records of a quality control review, approval, or rejection for your Multivitamin Multimineral 100 or gorgeous roses products.  During the inspection, your logistics manager informed our investigator that he reviews the Certificate of Analysis (COA) received for each dietary supplement from the contract manufacturer and your Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) states “Check/Compare the Certificate of Analysis.” However, you had no records showing the date that the review, approval, or rejection was performed or the signature of the person performing the review, approval, or rejection, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2).  This lack of review is further evidenced by the investigator’s observation that the COA for your Multivitamin Multimineral 100 lists “silica” as one of the “other ingredients,” but silica is not present on the product label.
In your response received on March 2, 2020, you state that you had an SOP in place but found it to be insufficient. You state that “upon completion of the inspection of all components and labels, all processes are now signed and dated by Quality Control to verify in writing that this process is being followed.”  You also state that “any deficiencies found at the time of this last inspection have been rectified and filed.” We cannot evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide supporting documentation, such as a copy of the Quality Control personnel process, updated labels, or examples of documents signed and dated by your Quality Control personnel.
2. You failed to make and keep records sufficient to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.570(b) in that your complaint procedure does not ensure that the requirements of 21 CFR 111.570(b)(2) are met.  Specifically, your complaint procedure requires that information required in the customer complaint template be obtained.  However, the template does not require that the following information be documented:a. Documentation by the person who reviews the product complaint at the time of performance;b. The batch, lot, or control number of the dietary supplement, if available;c. The date the complaint was received;d. How the product was used, if known;e. The reply to the complainant, if any; andf. Findings of the investigation and follow-up action taken when an investigation is performed.
Your March 2, 2020 written response states, “An expanded SOP to include much more detail has been established and instituted for all Product Complaints emphasizing the role of Quality Control.”  You further identified the associated actions that will be performed by quality control.  We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide supporting documentation, such as the referenced SOP.
Once the complaint information has been received, a qualified person must review all product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury, as required by 21 CFR 111.560(a) and investigate any product complaint that involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of 21 CFR Part 111.  Further, quality control personnel must review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint and review and approve the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed, as required by 21 CFR 111.560(b).  The review and investigation of the product complaint by a qualified person, and the review by quality control personnel about whether to investigate a product complaint, and the findings and follow-up action of any investigation performed, must extend to all relevant batches and records, as required by 21 CFR 111.560(c).
3. Your written returned dietary supplement procedure fails to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.535(b) in that your procedure does not require you to make a material review and disposition decision, as required by 21 CFR 111.510 or to conduct an investigation of the manufacturing processes if the reason for the return of the supplement implicates other batches, as required by 21 CFR 111.530.  Specifically, your written returned dietary supplement procedure does not include a material review and disposition decision.  Examples of your “RETURNS – Check In and Inspection Report” were also provided with your procedure.  However, the procedure does not require, and the report does not include, documentation of the information required by 21 CFR 111.535(b)(2) and (b)(3):a. Any material review and disposition decision on a returned dietary supplement;b. The results of any testing or examination conducted to determine compliance with product specifications established under 111.70(e)
In your March 2, 2020 response, you state that your current SOP “has been refined to further clarify in detail your continued practice of destroying all returned dietary supplements. Our policy has always been and will remain to destroy all returned dietary supplements because of fear of contamination. Quality Control will record, document, sign and date all dietary supplement returns and their disposal.”  We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide supporting documentation, such as the referenced SOP.  Additionally, a material review and disposition decision is necessary regardless of whether the returned product will be destroyed; if the reason for a dietary supplement being returned implicates other batches, you must conduct an investigation of your manufacturing processes and other batches to determine compliance with specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.530.
4. You failed to make and keep documentation of training, including the date of training, type of training and persons trained, as required by 21 CFR 111.14(b)(2).  Specifically, our investigator determined that your firm has a written training program for new hires and(b)(4)refresher training; however, you do not have any records that document the date of training, type of training, and persons trained.
Your March 2, 2020 written response states, “Training will take place(b)(4).  All SOP’s will be reviewed in detail and any(b)(4)training needed will be documented, signed and filed by Quality Control and a Supervisor/CEO or other third party as appropriate.”  We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective action because you did not provide supporting documentation, such as training records.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your Multivitamin Multimineral 100 and gorgeous roses dietary supplement products are misbranded under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements defined in 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Multivitamin Multimineral 100 is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4.  Specifically, Silica is identified in the certificate of analysis under “Other Ingredients”; however, it is not listed on the product label under other ingredients.  Additionally, the certificate of analysis shows that the capsule ingredient is “microcrystalline cellulose.”  Your label lists “Vegetable cellulose” as an ingredient, but “Vegetable cellulose” is not the common or usual name for microcrystalline cellulose.
2. Your gorgeous roses dietary supplement product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36.  Specifically, the % Daily Value for biotin should be 11,110% instead of 1,111%.
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility or in connection with your products.  You are responsible for ensuring that your facility operates in compliance with the Act and other applicable laws and regulations.  You should take prompt action to correct the violations noted in this letter.  Failure to do so may result in legal action by the FDA without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
We note that your gorgeous roses dietary supplement product statement of identity fails to be in a size reasonably related to the most prominent printed matter on the front of the label, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(d).
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days of the receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct the stated violations, including an explanation of each step being taken to identify violations and actions taken to ensure that similar violations will not recur. In your response, you should include documentation, including revised procedures, photographs, and other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections.  If the corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen (15) working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be implemented. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act, (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31), authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA's costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs.  A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA's arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility.  The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act.  Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.
Your written response should be sent to Patricia F. Hudson, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 8th Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309.  If you have any questions regarding the content of this letter, please contact Patricia F. Hudson at404-253-2221or email atpatricia.hudson@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTERCMS # 606293
Dear Mr. Mancuso:
Between January 8, 2020, and January 23, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your dietary supplement facility located at 69 Mall Drive, Commack, NY 11725. During the inspection, our investigators found significant violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your Thermal Revolution Black, Anabolic Blackout Raspberry Lemonade, Militia Re-COMP, and Rhino Rampage Wildberry dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplement products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). You can find the Act and the FDA’s regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
We have not received a response from your firm concerning the observations noted on the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm on January 23, 2020.
During the inspection, we observed the following significant violations of the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to verify, for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, your firm's product specification sheets for finished product assay testing for Thermal Revolution Black 45 Caps, lot # C191014, exp. 10/22; Anabolic Blackout Raspberry Lemonade, lot # P191068, exp. 10/22; Militia Re-COMP 60 capsules, lot # C190929, exp. 9/22; and Rhino Rampage Wildberry 210g powder, lot # 190893, exp. 8/22 indicates assay testing was based on production input rather than on any type of analytical testing of the finished product. The input of a dietary ingredient alone is not sufficient to verify its specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition in a finished product. All tests and examinations that are employed to determine whether a specification has been met must be scientifically valid in accordance with 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). The addition of a dietary ingredient into a product formulation is a manufacturing step; it is not a definitive test method that yields a measured result, nor is it able to assess the ingredient in the finished dietary supplement product when other components are present.
To meet the requirement in 21 CFR 111.75(c), you must provide adequate documentation of your basis for why meeting the specification(s) selected under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(1), through the use of appropriate tests or examinations conducted under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(2), will ensure that your finished batch of dietary supplement meets all product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c)(3), and you must keep documentation for why the result of appropriate tests or examinations for the product specifications selected under 21 CFR 111.75(c)(1) ensure that the dietary supplement meets all product specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(4).
2. Your firm failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, for use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). Specifically, you do not have the proper laboratory controls in place to conduct the(b)(4)which includes the use of criteria for selecting reference standard materials used in performing tests and examinations. The raw material identification test that you use for(b)(4), was not compared to a reference standard.
3. Your quality control personnel approved and released for distribution a batch of dietary supplement(s) that did not meet established product specifications in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e), in violation of 21 CFR 111.123(b)(2). Specifically, your batch production record for Militia Re-COMP 60 Capsules, lot # C190929 documents that the ingredient,(b)(4)went into the finished batch of dietary supplements; however, your raw material test results indicates it was the ingredient,(b)(4)that actually went into the finished batch.
4. You failed to suitably dispose of label and packaging for dietary supplements that are obsolete or incorrect to ensure that they are not used in any future packaging and label operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.415(h). Specifically, the labels for your Anabolic Blackout Raspberry Lemonade Lot P191068 lists(b)(4)in the ingredient list; however, you stated during the inspection that you were unable to obtain this ingredient, but you continued to use this incorrect label.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. Sections 302 and 304 of the Act provide for seizure of violative products and injunction against the manufacturers and distributors of violative products [21 U.S.C. §§ 332 and 334].
Within fifteen working days of the receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees (21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: # HAFW4-20-05-WL
Dear Mr. Cheadle:
From March 3, 2020, through March 18, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 4565 Kipling St., Wheatridge, Colorado. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, our review of your product labeling that we collected during the inspection revealed that certain of your dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act. You can find copies of the Act and its implementing regulations through links on FDA’s homepage atwww.fda.gov.
We acknowledge receipt of your responses to the FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, dated March 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020, and we address your responses in the paragraphs below.Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplements are in violation of the CGMP requirements for dietary supplements because you failed to establish and follow written procedures for holding and distributing operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.453. Specifically, you receive packaged and labeledfinished dietary supplement products at your firm for holding and distribution; however, you have not established written procedures to ensure your dietary supplements are held under appropriate conditions of temperature, humidity, and light so that the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements are not affected (21 CFR 111.455(a)).
We have reviewed your FDA-483 responses, dated March 27, 2020, and May 27, 2020. Your March 27, 2020, response stated how holding and distributing operations are performed but did not include written procedures for our review. For example, you stated that your products are stored on shelves in your “temperature-controlled, secure lobby,” but you did not provide an SOP for storage specifying the temperature. Your May 27, 2020, response states that your “Holding and Distributing Procedures” are “in place” but provided no further supporting documentation for our review.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your Fos-Idophilus, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, and Ur-NAry Fresh products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your System Fresh product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Specifically, the directions of use for your System Fresh product suggests the consumer take 2 to 3 capsules daily but the serving size lists 2 capsules. The serving size listed should be the maximum amount of product per eating occasion.
2. Your D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)], in that the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example:
Your D-Stress product label fails to include the part of the plant from which gota kola herb and wood betany are derived.
Your Herbal N-Zyme product label fails to include the part of the plant from which catnip gota kola, and wood betany are derived.
Your Ur-N-Ary Fresh product label fails to include the part of the plant from which cleavers herb, cranberry extract, catnip herb, garlic, and cornsilk are derived.
3. Your Fos-Idophilus, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutritional information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR Part 101.36. For example:
Regarding your Fos-Idophilus product:
o It fails to declare calories in the correct increment as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(1);o It fails to include a heavy bar beneath the last (b)(2)-dietary ingredient as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6);o It fails to include the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calories diet.” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D);o It fails to declare total carbohydrate instead of total carbohydrates as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(6);o It fails to express dietary fiber to the nearest gram and indented below total carbohydrate as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(6)(i);o It fails to place “Daily value not established” only at the bottom of the Supplement Facts label and not collocated with a listed ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(3).
Regarding your Herbal N-Zyme product:
o It fails to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving size of all the dietary ingredients as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii);o It fails to place “Servings Per Container” below the serving size as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(ii).
In addition, your System Fresh, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh Supplement Facts labels declare ingredients that appear to be part of a proprietary blend, but the labels fail to indent those ingredients under the term ""Proprietary Blend"" as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c).
4. Your Fos-Idophilus, Breathe Eze, D-Stress, Herbal N-Zyme, System Fresh, and Ur-N-Ary Fresh products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the product label fails to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 21 CFR 101.4(g)-(h). For example:
Your Breathe Eze product declares “Brigham Tea Leaf”, your D-Stress product declares “Kola Nut”, your D-Stress and Herbal N-Zyme products declare “gota kola”, your System Fresh product declares “turkey rhubarb”, and your Ur-N-Ary Fresh product declares “nettles”. These names are not standardized common names (SCN) noted in Herbs of Commerce.
Your Fos-Idophilus product incorrectly places “Other ingredients” within the Supplement Facts label.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct all the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. Your Fos-Idophilus product label fails to use the term “net weight” in the declaration of the net quantity of contents in terms of weight in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7(j)(3).2. Your Fos-Idophilus product declares “at the time of manufacture” and your Ur-N-Ary Fresh product declares “40,000 SHU/g” within the Supplements Facts label. These phrases are considered intervening material and are not permitted in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(e).3. Your D-Stress, Ur-N-Ary Fresh, and Breathe Eze, and Herbal N-Zyme Supplement Facts labels incorrectly declare “Ingredient”
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation, such as photographs, corrective actions taken to date, or other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections.
Further, section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs mean all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the inspection and assessing and collecting the inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.

Dear Mr. Heathco:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.leslabs.com/products/detoxx-for-hangovers in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product DeToxx for Hangovers. The claims on your website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your website that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
• “DETOXX FOR HANGOVERS” (image of product label and website)• “DeToxx helps reduce hangover symptoms . . . Natural ingredients including milk thistle, prickly pear and cysteine work while you drink, helping to metabolize the toxins that cause hangover symptoms . . .” (website)• “Helps prevent hangover symptoms*” (image of product label and website)
A statement claims to mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases [see 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(ii)]. A hangover is a sign or symptom of alcohol intoxication, a disease. Like all poisonings, alcohol intoxication causes dose-related dysfunctioning and damage, ranging from mild impairments to death. Alcohol intoxication causes temporary damage to brain function, causing impairments of judgment, attention, reflexes, and coordination. Therefore, alcohol intoxication meets the definition of disease in 21 CFR 101.93(g)(1) [see 65 Fed. Reg. 1000, 1015 (Jan. 6, 2000)].
Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Based on the product label on your website, it appears that you intend to market your DeToxx for Hangovers product, which contains N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), as a dietary supplement. However, even if your product labeling did not have therapeutic claims that make your product an unapproved new drug, your product could not be a dietary supplement, because it does not meet the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded that NAC products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)]. Under this provision, if an article (such as NAC) has been approved as a new drug under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355], then products containing that article are outside the definition of a dietary supplement, unless before such approval that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food. NAC was approved as a new drug under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355] on September 14, 1963. FDA is not aware of any evidence that NAC was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food prior to that date.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct the violations described in this letter and to prevent similar violations. Include any documentation necessary to show that correction has been achieved. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

Dear Mr. Shaw:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://happyhourvitamins.com/ in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product Happy Hour Vitamins (H2V). FDA also observed that you sell this product on Amazon.com at https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M2F1NNY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00M2F1NNY&linkCode=as2&tag=happyhourvita-20&linkId=DCFNNAEYLGHEN7D7&th=1 (“your Amazon sale page”). The claims on your website and Amazon sale page establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your website https://happyhourvitamins.com/ that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
Home page:• “Multivitamin Specially Formulated to Help with Hangovers.”• “Specially formulated to help you Avoid Hangovers . . .”• “HELPS AVOID HANGOVERS!” (image of product label)• “MULTIVITAMIN SPECIALLY FORMULATED TO HELP YOU AVOID HANGOVERS”• “Convenient individual packets makes hangover prevention easy by taking 1 dose (2 hangover pills) before/while drinking.”• “KILL YOUR HANGOVER BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS with powerful vitamin, mineral, anti-oxidant, herbal blend. Preventing hangovers works better than a hangover cure or cures you can try.”• “GET RID OF TOXIC ACETALDEHYDE POISONING that adds to your hangovers with N-acetyl Cysteine [ingredient in Happy Hour Vitamins (H2V)]. Protect your liver with milk thistle, kudzu flower powder, and artichoke leaf extract [ingredients in Happy Hour Vitamins (H2V)]. Paired with water makes the perfect hangover kit.”• “These are the hangover cure pills you are looking for!”• “Hangovers are much more than just dehydration. . . Headache often occurs when alcohol in the bloodstream absorbs all the vitamins and nutrients from the body’s organs. The shortage of vitamins and nutrients leads to organ dehydration, after which the organs begin to steal hydration from the brain. When this happens, the brain actually shrinks and the blood vessels become inflamed, making it harder for blood to flow through the brain and causing immense pressure.Solution: Take in a healthy dose of vitamins & nutrients prior to drinking”• “Hangovers are much more than just dehydration. . . Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting all go hand in hand. For some, simply binge eating while drinking lots of alcohol causes an awful upset stomach. The body’s reaction to all the toxins from alcohol coupled with dehydration amplifies these symptoms as well. Acute or chronic binge drinkers can develop normal bouts of diarrhea from chronic ethanol ingestion. While vomiting is very unpleasant, it is the body’s natural defenses in action. So for many, vomiting may help ease symptoms of hangover to an extent. These are truly the hangover vitamins you need.”
How H2V Works page:• “Antioxidants can help the body deal with toxins & other effects from alcohol
Your body will thank you for the Antioxidant rich Acai Berry, Goji Berry & Green Tea extracts which are all part of Happy Hour Vitamins cutting edge proprietary blend.
Here is an excerpt from Annals of Internal Medicine examining the staggering cost of hangovers (Wiese et al. 2000)
‘The staggering cost of alcoholic hangover could be significantly mitigated if drinkers took the right antioxidants before going to bed.’”• “Happy Hour Vitamins contains Thiamine which has been used to help calm the effects of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.”• “Avoid Hangovers . . . with Happy Hour Vitamins”
Our Story page:• “I started thinking that it would be great if there was a multivitamin specifically formulated for the drinking population. One that would help support the bar industry lifestyle by focusing on . . . the reduction of hangover symptoms. . . . So, I hired people much smarter than myself to create Happy Hour Vitamins . . .”• “HOW TO STOP THE STRUGGLE WITH HANGOVERSHere is what makes Happy Hour Vitamins specific formulation for the drinking population so special . . .”
Bars & Resellers page:• “With the H2V Partner Program, you can start making more money by selling the most effective hangover cure on the market.”
Your website also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Happy Hour Vitamins (H2V) for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
• “I struggled with hangovers while working as bartender for over a decade. Striving to find a hangover cure, I hired a PhD chemist and consulted medical professionals to create Happy Hour Vitamins, hangover vitamins. Now Happy Hour Vitamins allow me to avoid my hangovers . . .” (Home page)• “I got these for my wedding ‘Emergency Hang-over Kits’. They work wonders; everyone was so excited to wake up the next morning and not feel sluggish or tired or have a major headache.” (Home page)• “I keep the packets in my purse and when I start drinking I just take them its [sic] as easy as that and bam no hangover!” (How H2V Works page)• “I am a bartender and always advise my customers to take a couple before beginning their shenanigans for the evening. They always come back and thank me for introducing them to Happy Hour Vitamins. I tell them that is easy to sell, no one wants a hangover!” (Bars & Resellers page)
Also, claims made on your Amazon sale page https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M2F1NNY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00M2F1NNY&linkCode=as2&tag=happyhourvita-20&linkId=DCFNNAEYLGHEN7D7&th=1 provide further evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug. For example:
• “Happy Hour Vitamins Formulated for Hangovers . . .”• “HELPS AVOID HANGOVERS!” (image of product label)• “HAPPY HOUR VITAMINS IS A MULTIVITAMIN SPECIALLY FORMULATED TO HELP WITH HANGOVERS. Convenient individual packets makes hangover prevention easy by taking 1 dose (2 hangover pills) before/while drinking. On days of extended drinking we suggest a second dose later in the evening. Forgot to take Happy Hour Vitamins and woke up Hungover? Take a pack of Happy Hour Vitamins as your hangover cure!”• “These are the hangover pills you need for the perfect wedding, bachelor, bachelorette, vacation, party or everyday hangover kit!”• “KILL YOUR HANGOVER BEFORE IT EVEN STARTS with powerful vitamin, mineral, electrolyte, anti-oxidant, herbal blend now with prickly pear extract! Preventing hangovers works better than a hangover cure or cures you can try.”• “GET RID OF TOXIC ACETALDEHYDE POISONING that adds to your hangovers with N-acetyl Cysteine [ingredient in Happy Hour Vitamins (H2V)].

Dear Mr. Wood:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses https://doublewoodsupplements.com/products/dycetin-box and https://www.dycetin.com/ in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product Dycetin. The claims on your websites establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your websites https://doublewoodsupplements.com/products/dycetin-box and https://www.dycetin.com/ that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
• “PREVENT HANGOVERS - No product is more proven or effective at preventing hangover symptoms including headaches, nausea, brain-fog, and anxiety.”• “PROTECT YOUR LIVER AND BRAIN - Research shows Dycetin reduces alcohol induced damage to the liver and brain.”• “Dycetin is the most effective hangover preventing supplement currently available.”• “Not only does DHM [ingredient in Dycetin] enhance enzymes in the liver responsible for breaking down alcohol and its toxic by-products, but it also reduces the effect alcohol has on GABA receptors in the brain. This keeps you feeling more sober while drinking and greatly reduces hangover symptoms the next day.”
In addition, some of the claims on your website https://www.dycetin.com/ that provide further evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include:
Home page:• “Top Rated National Hangover Prevention Supplement”• “NEVER SUFFER ANOTHER HANGOVER”• “Dycetin tablets protect your liver and brain from alcohol, prevent hangovers . . .”
Buy Dycetin Now page:• “ADVANCED HANGOVER PREVENTION FORMULA” (image of product label)• “DYCETIN is a potent hangover prevention supplement which contains both Dihydromyricetin and a blend of electrolytes. It may reduce hangover symptoms by up to 99%.” (image of product label)• “To reduce feelings of alcohol intoxication, take one tablet before you start drinking, and one additional tablet after finishing your first two drinks.” (image of product label)
How to Use Dycetin page:• “Dycetin can be used in three main ways - to prevent hangovers after a night of drinking, to reduce feelings of intoxication while drinking, or to raise the alcohol intoxication threshold so you can have a few drinks without becoming intoxicated.”•“Preventing Hangovers with DycetinTo prevent hangovers with Dycetin, take 2 tablets at the end of the night with a large glass of water.”
•“Preventing Alcohol IntoxicationIf you’ll be attending a social function where drinking is expected but you’d prefer not to become intoxicated, Dycetin can help. Simply take 2 tablets 30 minutes before drinking and you’ll be able to drink a 2-3 beers without noticing any intoxication.”
Dycetin FAQ page:• “Dycetin is a natural scientifically proven hangover prevention supplement that blocks the affect alcohol has on the brain and allows the liver to process alcohol more quickly. Taking Dycetin after a night on the town will allow you to wake up feeling normal rather than being stuck in bed with a crippling hangover.”• “Dycetin’s main ingredient, Dihydromyricetin, is the only single ingredient scientifically proven to prevent hangovers. It does this both by blocking alcohol’s effect on the brain’s GABA receptors and by allowing the liver to clear alcohol and its toxic byproduct acetaldehyde from the body at a much faster rate than normal. Combined, these effects allow Dycetin to prevent hangovers and reduce feelings of alcohol intoxication.”• “To prevent a hangover, take 2 tablets of Dycetin before bed with a large glass of water.”
Your website https://www.dycetin.com/ also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of Dycetin for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
• “This stuff really works. Either before you imbibe, or after. If you have had too much to drink, it will stop the spins, and staggers, and you don't get a hangover the next morning. It will knock out an existing hangover as well.”• “I tried it before drinking once and it was like I was drinking non-alcoholic beer, I wasn't even phased. I take it at the end of a long night of partying on a weeknight and am up for work at 7 and even feel more tired than hungover at all. It also does well to take mid-drinking in order to keep from getting out of line.”
A statement claims to mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases [see 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(ii)]. A hangover is a sign or symptom of alcohol intoxication, a disease. Like all poisonings, alcohol intoxication causes dose-related dysfunctioning and damage, ranging from mild impairments to death. Alcohol intoxication causes temporary damage to brain function, causing impairments of judgment, attention, reflexes, and coordination. Therefore, alcohol intoxication meets the definition of disease in 21 CFR 101.93(g)(1) [see 65 Fed. Reg. 1000, 1015 (Jan. 6, 2000)].
Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)].

RE: 593771
July 23, 2020Dear Mr. Radziszewski:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses http://takepartypal.com and https://ebnsol.com/products/partypal-5-pack in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product PartyPalTM. The claims on your websites establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your websites that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
On http://takepartypal.com:
•“How does it work and how did we create it?
Understanding the history of alcohol consumption led us to believe that throughout the ages different cultures have traditionally applied a variety of natural remedies for hangover relief and prevention as well as to help nullify the toll nightlife could have on the body.We researched and tested dozens of these traditionally used natural remedies and ingredients from around the world. We tried and tested them separately and in different combinations and concentrations.
One tested combination of ingredients in unique concentrations proved uniquely effective against hangovers: Prickly Pear Cactus, Succinic Acid, and Oriental Raisin Tree. These three ingredients in our proprietary concentrations are what make up our 3Contrx® complex.”
On https://ebnsol.com/products/partypal-5-pack:
• “We bring you 3ContRx [ingredient blend in PartyPal], the most effective hangover treatments from 3 different parts of the globe all combined into easy to use tablets that REALLY WORK!”• “THE SAFER WAY TO ENJOY CACTUS – Having a hangover can really ruin your day. Nausea, dry mouth, dizziness; all of these symptoms we know all too well. However, with Prickly Pear Cactus Extract [ingredient in PartyPal], you can say goodbye to the day-after woes! By reducing inflammation associated with a hangover and increasing the ability for your cells to repair themselves after a night of drinking debauchery, you can feel better right away!”• “Dihydromyricetin, or DHM [ingredient in PartyPal], is a truly scientific way to prevent the dreaded hangover.”• “GUARANTEED RELIEF – We take this product ourselves, and are proud to present it to you as a true hangover cure.”
A statement claims to mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases [see 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(ii)]. A hangover is a sign or symptom of alcohol intoxication, a disease. Like all poisonings, alcohol intoxication causes dose-related dysfunctioning and damage, ranging from mild impairments to death. Alcohol intoxication causes temporary damage to brain function, causing impairments of judgment, attention, reflexes, and coordination. Therefore, alcohol intoxication meets the definition of disease in 21 CFR 101.93(g)(1) [see 65 Fed. Reg. 1000, 1015 (Jan. 6, 2000)].
Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)].

Dear Dr. Burke:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.hangoverheaven.com/ in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product Hangover Heaven Nightlife Prep Supplement. The claims on your website establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your website that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following:
• “Hangover Cure through Prevention”• “If you take our supplements you will have much less of a hangover the next morning.”• “These supplements contain ingredients that help your body deal with the breakdown products of alcohol, which cause hangovers.”• “Hangover Heaven Nightlife Prep is a physician and PhD formulated hangover prevention product designed to be taken before drinking to reduce hangover symptoms the next day.”• “Dosing depends on how much you plan to drink and the severity of your hangovers.”• “Hangover Heaven IV Hydration is the first medical practice dedicated to the treatment, prevention, and cure of hangovers. With Hangover Heaven Nightlife Prep Supplements, you can significantly reduce your changes [sic] of having a hangover.”• “Best Hangover Pills to Prevent Hangovers”
A statement claims to mitigate, treat, cure, or prevent disease if it claims, explicitly or implicitly, that the product has an effect on the characteristic signs or symptoms of a specific disease or class of diseases [see 21 CFR 101.93(g)(2)(ii)]. A hangover is a sign or symptom of alcohol intoxication, a disease. Like all poisonings, alcohol intoxication causes dose-related dysfunctioning and damage, ranging from mild impairments to death.

Therefore, alcohol intoxication meets the definition of disease in 21 CFR 101.93(g)(1) [see 65 Fed. Reg. 1000, 1015 (Jan. 6, 2000)].
Your product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drug” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Based on the product label on your website, it appears that you intend to market your Hangover Heaven Nightlife Prep Supplement product, which contains N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), as a dietary supplement. However, even if your product labeling did not have therapeutic claims that make your product an unapproved new drug, your product could not be a dietary supplement, because it does not meet the definition of dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. FDA has concluded that NAC products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)]. Under this provision, if an article (such as NAC) has been approved as a new drug under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355], then products containing that article are outside the definition of a dietary supplement, unless before such approval that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food. NAC was approved as a new drug under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355] on September 14, 1963. FDA is not aware of any evidence that NAC was marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food prior to that date.

Dear Mr. Elias:
This is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://gotpurpletree.com/ in June 2020 and observed that you take orders there for the product Purple Tree. FDA also observed that you sell this product on Amazon.com at https://www.amazon.com/Hangover-Prevention-Dihydromyricetin-L-Cysteine-California/dp/B072HGQC4X (“your Amazon sale page”). The claims on your website and Amazon sale page establish that the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your website https://gotpurpletree.com/ that provide evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug include the following
• “Purple Tree® is a natural multivitamin specifically designed to reduce alcohol's negative effects in the body . . . Hangovers hinder our work, fitness and family routines, so we embarked on a mission to help health-conscious adults who drink . . .” (FAQs page)• “Yes, Purple Tree is a hangover prevention pill that works.” (FAQs page)• “Although a hangover cure for heavy-drinking situations like this does not exist, Purple Tree surely helps to mitigate some of the hangover symptoms, if taken beforehand.” (FAQs page)• “Purple Tree’s key ingredient is called Dihydromyricetin (DHM), an extract from the Japanese Raisin Tree, which has been used for centuries as an anti-alcohol herb and hangover cure in Asia.” (How it Works page)• “Say Goodbye to Hangovers . . . SHOP NOW” (appears next to image of the Purple Tree product on the Journal page)• “Purple Tree – Supplement for Hangover Prevention” (Hangover Pills product page)• “Our hangover prevention pills were crafted by Doctors and Scientists with vast experience in natural supplements.” (Hangover Pills product page)
Also, claims made on your Amazon sale page https://www.amazon.com/Hangover-Prevention-Dihydromyricetin-L-Cysteine-California/dp/B072HGQC4X provide further evidence that your product is intended for use as a drug. For example:
• “Purple Tree Hangover Cure & Prevention Pills”• “HELPS PREVENT HANGOVER SYMPTOMS”• “Purple Tree’s science-backed formula includes Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a liver detox and hangover prevention ingredient. DHM is a natural extract that has been used as anti-alcohol herb and hangover cure since ancient medicine.*”• “Purple Tree helps to prevent hangover symptoms . . .”• “Key Benefits . . . helps to combat alcohol’s negative effects in the body, including hangover*”• “Key Ingredientso Dihydromyricetin (DHM) is derived from the Japanese Raisin Tree (Hovenia Dulcis) – it has been used for centuries as an anti-alcohol herb and hangover cure in Asia.*o White Willow Bark, also called ‘Nature’s Aspirin’, acts as a natural anti-inflammatory agent in the human body.*o Milk Thistle helps to protect the liver from damage.*”• “Our hangover prevention pills were crafted by Doctors and Scientists with vast experience in natural supplements.”

Dear Mr. Costilla:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 1342 Rocky Point Dr., Oceanside, CA on January 13, 15-16, and 22-23, 2020. The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the dietary supplement products manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
During the inspection, we also collected labels for several of your BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand products. A subsequent review of the labeling of these products establish that they are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] as detailed below.
You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We have received your written response dated February 19, 2020, concerning the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on January 23, 2020.We address your response below in regard to the specific violations.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Our inspection of your facility revealed the following significant violations of CGMP requirements for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to establish finished product specifications for each dietary supplement for the identity, purity, strength, and composition for the finished batch of the dietary supplement that you manufacture to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you failed to establish finished product specifications for the following products:
a) MRM Nutrition brand Neuro-Max II Nootropic.b) Dr. Beckers BioNutrients brand Glucomannan Fiber.c) BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Vitami-Life.d) BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Biotropic.e) BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Desintoxicador #3.
In your response received on February 19, 2020, you asserted that your method to ensure purity includes(b)(4)product testing for certain contaminants and a new contaminant detection system, that your specifications for strength will include locating a qualified person to analyze your raw materials using a(b)(4)system, and that your specifications for identity include a new process to analyze the(b)(4)from the production records. You also provided “(b)(4)” for the Neuro-Max II Nootropic and Biotropic products, which you assert help demonstrate your corrective actions. However, while your response correctly identifies certain contaminants of concern, the act of testing for the presence of such contaminants, or of analyzing raw materials or finished products, is not a specification. Specifications establish criteria such as the minimum or maximum quantity of a substance, or the absence of a particular contaminant, to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement. A possible specification would be, for example, no more than(b)(4)of a particular potential contaminant. Moreover, the testing that you purport to use for purity does not actually test for purity. Rather, the testing you describe relating to “purity” is actually for limits of contamination. Your testing for strength may be adequate once you have hired a qualified analyst to operate the(b)(4)but testing is not a specification. Your response also does not explain what you mean by ""(b)(4)"" or how it would provide information on product identity, so we are unable to evaluate this part of your proposed correction relating to product identity.
2. You failed to have quality control operations determine whether all labels conform to specifications established under 21 CFR 111.70(d), as required by 21 CFR 111.120(b). Specifically, your product labels for the following products do not conform with the specifications as established in the relevant MMRs:a) For your BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Vitami-Life and BioLife Nature's Supplements brand BioMultivitamins, the MMR includes the following components that are not listed on the product label: Vitamin A 250,000 IU, Vitamin K2 MK7 1% on DCP, Boron Citrate, Zinc Citrate 32%, Copper Sulfate, Selenium, 72 Trace Mineral, Coral Calcium, Manganese Chelate 20%, Iodine (from Kelp), Chromium Polynicotinate, Molybdenum Chelate 0.2%, Vanadyl Sulfate, and Potassium Phosphate.b) For your BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Biotropic, the MMR includes following the components that are not listed on the product label: Red 40 FD&C, aloe vera, and Moringa.
In your response received February 19, 2020, you acknowledged that your(b)(4)did not conduct a material review and make a disposition decision but stated(b)(4)training was ongoing to ensure that each(b)(4)is familiarized with all SOPs and procedures. However, you did not include documentation of the revised MMR and labels in your response or otherwise provide training records for your(b)(4)or other records to demonstrate your corrective actions.
3. Your MMRs failed to include all information as required by 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your MMRs for products MRM Nutrition brand Neuro-Max II Nootropic and BioLife Nature's Supplements brand Vitami-Life, Desintoxicador #3, and Biotropic failed to include a representative label or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g).
In your response received on February 19, 2020, you provided copies of the MMRs for the products Neuro-Max II Nootropic and Biotropic; however, the MMRs do not include a representative label or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label. Additionally, you did not provide revised MMRs for the products Vitami-Life and Desintoxicador #3.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for laboratory operations, including written procedures for the tests and examinations that you conduct to determine whether specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.303. For example, you did not have written procedures for the following laboratory operations used to determine whether one or more specifications for your Neuro-Max II Nootropic, Glucomannan Fiber, Vitami-Life, Biotropic, and Desintoxicador #3 are met:a) Use of your(b)(4)spectroscopy ((b)(4)).b) Use of your(b)(4)instrument.c) Use of your(b)(4)machine.d) Creating qualified reference standards for the(b)(4)testing performed.
We have reviewed your response dated February 19, 2020, in which you stated(b)(4). Because no laboratory procedures were provided, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
We reviewed the labeling of your for BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand dietary supplement products collected during this inspection and determined that these products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] in that the labels for these products do not comply with the labeling requirements in 21 CFR 101 for the reasons described below:
1. Your BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand Vitamin-Life, Bio Multivitamins, Detoxifier 3, Desintoxicador #3, and Tropic-Aid products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutritional information on the labeling of the products do not comply with 21 CFR Part 101.36. For example:a) For the Vitamin-Life and Desintoxicador #3 products, the labels fail to include the Supplement Facts heading, while for the Bio Multivitamins and Detoxifier 3 products, the heading is incorrectly identified as “Nutrition Facts,” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).b) For the Vitamin-Life and Tropic-Aid products the nutrients are not listed in the order required by 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(v) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).c) For the Bio Multivitamins product, the proprietary blend incorrectly declares (b)(2)-dietary ingredients with (b)(3)-dietary ingredients. The declaration of (b(2)-dietary ingredients must be in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(1) and 101.36(b)(2)(i).d) For the Vitami-Life and Bio Multivitamins products, the declared (b)(2)-dietary ingredient names are not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(8)(iv)-(v).e) For the Vitami-Life and Bio Multivitamins products, the source ingredient for each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient fails to be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).f) For the Vitamin-Life and Desintoxicador #3 products, the labels fail to include the subheading “Serving Size” placed under the heading of and aligned on the left side of the nutrition label, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(i).g) For the Vitamin-Life, Detoxifier 3, and Desintoxicador #3 products, the labels fail to include:i. The heading of “% Daily Value,” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(A),”ii. The percent Daily Value of each (b)(2)-dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B), based on the serving size, oriii. A symbol placed in the “Percent Daily Value” column that refers to the same symbol placed at the bottom of the nutrition label and followed by the statement “Daily Value not established,” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(A), (B), or (F).h) For the Bio Multivitamins product, the “% Daily Value” header is incorrectly identified as the “% USRDA*” and fails to list the percent or symbol required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(A) or (F).i) For the Bio Tropic and Tropic-Aid products, the Supplement Facts labels include nutrients which are or can be expressed as zero. Such nutrients may not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).j) For the Bio Tropic product, the Supplement Facts label is not listed on the information panel which is immediately contiguous to and to the right of the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.2(b).k) For the Bio Tropic and Tropic-Aid product, the Calories declaration is not listed first in the column of names, beneath a light bar separating the heading ""Amount Per Serving"" from the list of names, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)(1). In addition, the quantitative amount per serving is not expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c)(1).l) For the Tropic-Aid and Bio Tropic products, the % DV for the total carbohydrate and sodium is incorrect. For the Tropic-Aid product, the % DV for the dietary fiber is incorrect. For the Bio Tropic product, the unit of measure for fiber is incorrect and we suggest the % DV be reevaluated and calculated in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B).m) For the Vitami-Life, Bio Multivitamins, Detoxifier 3, and Tropic-Aid products, the other ingredients list fails to be placed immediately below the Supplement Facts label as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).n) For the Tropic-Aid and Bio Tropic products, each label fails to correctly declare the quantitative amount of the proprietary blend in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii)(A). The quantitative amount by weight per serving must be expressed using metric measures in appropriate units (i.e., 1000 units must be declared in the next higher set of units, e.g., 1,100 mg must be expressed as 1.1 g)o) For the Desintoxicador #3 product, the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 diet” is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).p) For the Tropic-Aid product, “Values not established” is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(c)(3).

As required by 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
3. Your BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand Vitami-Life and Desintoxicador #3 products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that their labels fail to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
4. Your BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand Vitami-Life, Bio Multivitamins, Detoxifier 3, Desintoxicador #3, and Tropic-Aid products are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(q)(1)(B) because the labels fail to list the servings per container under the serving size on the left hand side of the nutrition label or fails to include this information as part of the net quantity of contents declaration in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).Specifically,a. The Vitami-Life and Tropic-Aid labels fail to list the servings per container.b. For the Bio Multivitamins and Detoxifier 3 products, the servings per container is incorrect. The serving size is listed as 2 capsules and the net quantity of contents for the container is 60 capsules. Therefore, the servings per container should be 30, not 60.
5. Your BioLife Nature’s Supplements brand Detoxifier 3, Bio Tropic, and Tropic-Aid products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).

Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection related costs.

WARNING LETTERCMS # 605076
June 18, 2020
Dear Mr. LoMacchio:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 3580 Oceanside Rd. Unit 5, Oceanside, NY 11572 on January 6-8, 13, and 21, 2020. During the inspection, we collected labels of your products. Based on inspectional findings, a subsequent review of the product labels collected during the inspection, and a subsequent review of your websites at the Internet addresses www.onlynaturalinc.com and www.bionutritioninc.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s website atwww.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your websites at www.onlynaturalinc.com and www.bionutritioninc.com in April 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for your Only Natural Alpha Lipoic Acid Plus, Only Natural Berberine 1000, Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Bio Nutrition Caraway Seed 1,000, Bio Nutrition Pycnogenol, Bio Nutrition Advanced Berberine 1200, and Bio Nutrition California Poppy Seed products. FDA also reviewed product labels collected during the January 2020 inspection for your Oww-Gout product. The claims on your labels and websites establish that your Only Natural Alpha Lipoic Acid Plus, Only Natural Berberine 1000, Bio Nutrition Caraway Seed 1,000, Bio Nutrition Pycnogenol, Bio Nutrition Advanced Berberine 1200, Bio Nutrition Cholesterol Wellness, Bio Nutrition California Poppy Seed, Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out) and Oww-Gout products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the label and website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Oww-Gout label:
“Gout…”
Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out) on www.bionutritioninc.com:
“Gout…”
Only Natural Alpha Lipoic Acid Plus on www.onlynaturalinc.com:
“Chromium and Vanadyl Sulfate are added and may stimulate insulin production to regulate blood sugar levels…”
“Chromium may support stable blood sugar levels through insulin utilization, which may benefit those with diabetes and hypoglycemia…”
Only Natural Berberine 1000 on www.onlynaturalinc.com:
“Berberine has been traditionally used as a natural defense against yeast, parasites, fungus and bacteria’s…”
Bio Nutrition Caraway Seed 1,000 on www.onlynaturalinc.com:
“Caraway seeds have been used for centuries…to relieve pain and discomfort associated with intestinal gas and bloating…”
“Irritable Bowel Support…”
Bio Nutrition Pycnogenol on www.bionutritioninc.com:
“[A]ctive compounds act…as an anti-inflammatory…”
Bio Nutrition Advanced Berberine 1200 on www.bionutritioninc.com:
“[H]elpful with fungus, parasites, yeast, bacteria and digestive disorders…”
Bio Nutrition California Poppy Seed on www.bionutritioninc.com:
“Bio Nutrition California Poppy Seed has been used…to promote…pain relief…”
“Pain and Discomfort…”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under Section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Only Natural Alpha Lipoic Acid Plus, Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out), and Oww-Gout products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Only Natural Alpha Lipoic Acid Plus, Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out), and Oww-Gout products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your Oww-Gout and Bio Nutrition Urilow (formerly Gout Out) products were not unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, your products would also be misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. In addition, your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, Curcumin 500, Blood Sugar Support, Uric Acid Support, Glucosamine Plus, Sleep Wellness, Kidney Bladder Wellness, Total Skin Wellness, and Pine Pollen products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, and Curcumin 500 products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(f)] because your product labels contain information in two languages but does not repeat all the required label information (including the nutrition information) in both languages. In accordance with 21 CFR 101.15(c), if a product label contains any representation in a foreign language or foreign characters, all words, statements, and other information required by or under authority of the Act to appear on the label must appear in the foreign language.
2. Your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, Blood Sugar Support, Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid Support, Glucosamine Plus, Sleep Wellness, Kidney Bladder Wellness, and Pine Pollen products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
The Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, and Blood Sugar Wellness product labels state “in a natural base of…” but fails to list the quantitative amount for the ingredients of this base as the total weight of all other dietary ingredients contained [21 CFR 101.36(c)(3)]. If this base is a proprietary blend, it should be identified as such.
Your Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), and Uric Acid Support products fail to declare (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in the order specified in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
Your Blood Pressure Wellness, Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid Support, and Total Skin Wellness products declare one or more of the following: “Niacinamide”, “D-3”, “B-1”, “B-5”, “B-6”, and “B-12” which are not the common or usual names for (b)(2)-dietary ingredients, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(8)(iv)-(v).
Your Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, and Blood Sugar Wellness product labels fail to place the “%” sign following the numerical value of the declared Daily Value in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(B).
Your Blood Sugar Support product label fails to list chromium in the unit of measurement given in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B).
Your Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, and Total Skin Wellness product labels fail to list the name of the (b)(2)-dietary ingredient in the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). For example, chromium is a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient. The source ingredient, chromium picolinate may be declared in the Supplement Facts label or in an ingredient statement below the Supplement Facts label, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and (d).
Your Cholesterol Wellness product fails to correctly declare niacin, a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient; the term “no flush” is considered intervening material and is not permitted in the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(e). In addition, the source ingredient niacinamide should be declared in parentheses following the listing of niacin in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
Your Kidney Bladder Wellness product labels fail to declare the source of the Vitamin B-6, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d).
Each of your products’ Supplement Facts labels contain a statement “Each serving supplies” or “Each capsule supplies” or similar statement which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36 and is considered intervening material per 21 CFR 101.2(e).
Your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, Curcumin 500, Blood Sugar Support, Oww-gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid Support, Glucosamine Plus, Sleep Wellness, Total Skin Wellness, and Pine Pollen products bear the following statement: “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D)]
For your products that declare (b)(2)- and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients, the Supplement Facts labels fail to separate (b)(2)-dietary ingredients and (b)(3)-dietary ingredients by placement of a heavy bar. Furthermore, for all products, each Supplement Facts label must place a hairline rule centered between the lines of text to separate each (b)(2)- and/or (b)(3)-dietary ingredient from the dietary ingredient above and beneath it, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(5) and (e)(6)(ii).
3. Your Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, Curcumin 500, Blood Sugar Support, Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid, Glucosamine Plus, Sleep Wellness, Kidney Bladder Wellness, and Total Skin Wellness are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). Furthermore, if the whole or entire plant is used, that information must be declared on the Supplement Facts label. In addition, “herb” is not a specific part of a plant.
4. Your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Support, Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid Support, Kidney Bladder Wellness, Total Skin Wellness, and Pine Pollen products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(1)(B)] because the labels fail to declare the number of servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).5. Your Joint Wellness and Total Skin Wellness products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example, the source of the collagen should be included as part of the dietary ingredient name, e.g., bovine or chicken collagen. Furthermore, your Urilow (formerly Gout Out) product declares “Nu-Flo” in the ingredient list which is not the common or usual name of an ingredient.
6. Your Blood Sugar Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, and Blood Pressure Wellness products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product labeling bears nutrient content claims, but the product does not meet the requirements to make such claims. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product.
Specifically, each product’s label declares “super fruit antioxidants”. The Supplement Facts label of each product does not list any fruit ingredients with an established Reference Daily Intake (RDI). The antioxidant claim found on your products’ labels and the labeling on your website for your Cholesterol Wellness and Blood Pressure Wellness products is a nutrient content claim because it bears the nutrient content claim “super fruit antioxidant” formula but does not meet the requirements to make such a claim. Nutrient content claims using the term “antioxidant” must comply with the requirements listed in 21 CFR 101.54(g). These requirements state, in part, that for a product to bear such a claim, a reference daily intake (RDI) must have been established for each of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim, as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(1), and these nutrients must have recognized antioxidant activity, as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(2). The level of each nutrient that is the subject of the claim must also be sufficient to qualify for the claim under 21 CFR 101.54(b), (c), or (e), as required by 21 CFR 101.54(g)(3). Further, nutrient content claims using the term ""antioxidant"" must include the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim as part of the claim or, alternatively, the term ""antioxidant"" or ""antioxidants"" may be linked by a symbol (e.g., an asterisk) that refers to the same symbol that appears elsewhere on the same panel of the product label, followed by the name or names of the nutrients with recognized antioxidant activity [21 CFR 101.54(g)(4)]. The antioxidant claim on your labeling does not indicate the names of the nutrients that are the subject of the claim or link the nutrients with the claim by use of a symbol. The use of a nutrient content claim that uses the term “antioxidant” but does not comply with the requirements of 21 CFR 101.54(g) misbrands a product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act.
We note that there are alternative ways to convey the amount of the nutrients in your product to consumers. For example, the amount of a nutrient in a food may be stated on the product label or labeling in accordance with the requirements in 21 CFR 101.13(i). Percentage claims for dietary supplements may be stated in accordance with the requirements in 21 CFR 101.13(q)(3)(ii)(A) and (B). If you want to seek authorization to use your current claim, you may submit a petition requesting FDA to authorize a new nutrient content claim for one or more of the nutrients in your product (see 21 CFR 101.69). FDA’s review and authorization of a nutrient content claim prior to use in labeling ensures that the claim will provide consistent, meaningful information to consumers about the content of a product.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm comply with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
We also offer the following comment:
1. Your Joint Wellness, Blood Pressure Wellness, Cholesterol Wellness, Blood Sugar Wellness, Blood Sugar Support, Curcumin 500, Oww-Gout, Urilow (formerly Gout Out), Uric Acid Support, Glucosamine Plus, Sleep Wellness, Kidney Bladder Wellness, Total Skin Wellness, and Pine Pollen products contain the phrase “additional ingredients” which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g).

AMENDED WARNING LETTER
Dear Ms. Floyd:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 18538 142nd Avenue NE, Woodinville, Washington, on October 15, 2019, through November 8, 2019. Based on the inspectional findings and a subsequent review of your product labels collected during the inspection, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's website atwww.fda.gov.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements:
Based on our inspection, we have identified serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C.§ 342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
We received emailed correspondence from your consultant dated December 2, 2019, December 20, 2019, January 17, 2020, February 18, 2020, March 17, 2020, and April 17, 2020, submitted in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on November 8, 2019. The response letters discussed corrective actions that your firm has undertaken, as well as proposed timelines for the completion of corrective actions currently in progress. We address your responses below.The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
You failed to review all product complaints to determine whether the product complaint involves a possible failure of a dietary supplement to meet any of its specifications, or any other requirements of 21 CFR Part 111, including those specifications and other requirements that, if not met, may result in a risk of illness or injury, as required by 21 CFR 111.560(a). Specifically, during our inspection, a review of product complaints found that you failed to follow your procedures to investigate product complaints related to adverse events, including a complaint received on April 26, 2018, reporting burning of mouths and throats; a complaint received on January 10, 2019, reporting customers experiencing nausea, stomach aches, headaches, and some rashes; and another complaint received on January 10, 2019, reporting an ""allergic"" reaction, in order to identify root cause.
Your January 17, 2020, response provided revised procedures for product complaints and adverse event reporting, as well as a record of training provided regarding these procedures. We will verify your implementation of the revised procedures for product complaints and adverse event reporting during our next inspection. However, based on the documentation you provided in your March 17, 2020, response, we have on-going concerns with your review and investigation of product complaints your firm receives.Specifically, you included documentation of a Product Complaint Form, F4010-A, for the complaints you received on April 26, 2018, and both complaints received on January 10, 2019, which are referenced above, respectively. Each of the Forms F-4010A for these three complaints note that the complaints are not valid, and that an investigation is only required when a complaint is valid. These complaint forms lack the investigation details to determine how the safety risk of the products were assessed. According to the procedure in your response, a Corrective and Preventative Action (CAPA) is required to address root causes of complaints, but no CAPA appears to have been opened for these three complaints. In addition, the Food Safety Risk decision is circled as ""NO"" for each of the complaints, but all three complaints involved adverse events.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements:
In addition, your Cocktail Liposomal, Neem Synergy, and Matrix Electrolyte Powder products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Cocktail Liposomal product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product label fails to adequately declare soy allergen sources, as required by section 403(w) of the Act.
Section 201(qq) of the Act [ 21 U.S.C. § 321(qq)] defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
• The word ""Contains,"" followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients, in accordance with section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or
• The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen), in accordance with section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, your Cocktail Liposomal product label contains the statement ""Allergen statement.**LipoSorb is derived from soy lecithin. Third party testing shows no detectable amounts of soy."". Although the proprietary blend in the product's Supplement Facts label declares ""Phosphatidyl Choline (from Soy Lecithin),"" the Contains statement is not in the required format. If present, the Contains statement should be presented as described above, with soy being declared as the food source of the major allergen. In addition, the finished product description sheet provided to our investigator states the product formulation consists of(b)(4)% ""LipoSorb (Phosphatidyl Choline from purified Soy Lecithin)"". Also, the webpage for this product at www.biopureus.com states ""Contains Soy"". The amount of a soy- based ingredient listed in this product specification document and the Contains statement on the product webpage appears to require the Contains statement in the required format.
2. Your Neem Synergy and Cocktail Liposomal products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)], in that the labels fail to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). For example, those botanical dietary ingredients that identify the part of the plant as ""aerial parts"" fail to specify the exact aerial parts.
3. Your Cocktail Liposomal and Matrix Electrolyte Powder products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:a. Your Cocktail Liposomal product label declares the (b)(2)-dietary ingredient vitamin E as a component of a proprietary blend. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients contained in a proprietary blend shall be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(c)(1).
b. Your Cocktail Liposomal product label declares water and ethanol as components of the proprietary blend. Water and ethanol are solvents; thus, they cannot be declared as dietary ingredients in the Supplement Facts label. Furthermore, the label declares glycerine as a dietary ingredient in the proprietary blend, but this is not a dietary ingredient and must instead be listed in the ""Other Ingredients"" list, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).
c. Your Matrix Electrolyte Powder product label fails to list the (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in the order prescribed in 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).
4. Your Neem Synergy product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR101.4. For example:
a. The product label declares the dietary ingredient gudduchi, but that is not the standardized common name as listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce.
b. It appears several ingredients are extracts per the statements ""CO2 Full Spectrum Extract"" and ""PSE Post Supercritical Hydro Ethenolic Extract"" on the label, but the Supplement Facts label fails to state these ingredients are extracts.
c. The product label declares black pepper with the Latin binomial name ""Piper longum."" The Latin binomial name for black pepper is Piper nigrum. Piper longum is the Latin binomial name for long pepper. The label must clearly state whether the actual dietary ingredient in the product is black pepper (Piper nigrum) or long pepper (Piper longum).
5. Your Matrix Electrolyte Powder is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] in that the label fails to declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7. For example, the product label fails to state the net weight in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(b)(1).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with the Act and FDA's implementing regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure of violative products and/or injunction.
We offer the following comment:
1. Your Cocktail Liposomal, Neem Synergy, and Matrix Electrolyte Powder product labels do not appear to place a heavy bar below either the (b)(2)- or (b)(3)-dietary ingredients, as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6).
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct the violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA's costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identifiednon-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA's arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act.Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related to costs.
Your written reply should be sent to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021, to the attention of CDR Joshua Wireman, Compliance Officer. If you have any questions, please contact Compliance Officer Wireman at(425) 302-0345.

WARNING LETTER
Ref: # HAFW4-20-04-WL
Dear Mr. McMahon:
From November 19 to November 21, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) inspected your facilities located at 22 Country Road 3957, Farmington, New Mexico and 44 County Road 3697, Aztec, New Mexico. This inspection was conducted as a follow-up to the regulatory meeting held with your firm on April 3, 2019. Based on our inspection and subsequent review of your firm’s website at www.msminerals.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and FDA regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at www.msminerals.com in April 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for the products Got Arginine? and Energy Boost 70. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.Examples of some of the claims observed on your website that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs including the following:
Got Arginine?, product page• “Promoting wound healing by reparing [sic] tissue…”• “[C]an improve cardiovascular health and lessen symptoms related to strokes.”
Energy Boost 70, product page• “Energy Boost 70’S [sic] Minerals mineral complexes are the world’s finest electrolyte, which . . . reduces high blood pressure . . . and helps rebuild the immune system.”
Your Got Arginine? and Energy Boost 70 products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Got Arginine? and Energy Boost 70 products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amendable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use this product safely for the intended purposes. Accordingly, your Got Arginine? And Energy Boost 70 products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your Silver Boost and(b)(4)dietary supplement products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements (CGMP) regulations,Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111(21 CFR Part 111). Following the November 2019 inspection of your facility, FDA issued a Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, addressing the violations discussed below. We acknowledge receipt on December 9, 2019, of your undated response to the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, issued on November 7, 2019, and we address your response below.
1. You failed to verify that your finished batch of the dietary supplement meets product specifications for strength for a subset of finished dietary supplement batches that you identify through a sound statistical sampling plan (or for every finished batch), as required by 21 CFR 111.75(c). Specifically, during the inspection, your production and quality control staff stated that they have been unable to find a testing method to accurately confirm the strength of the silver in your Silver Boost product.
Note that you must ensure that any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 11.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We acknowledge receipt of your response on December 9, 2019, which states that you have updated your master manufacturing record (MMR) to an established strength of(b)(4)ppm. Your updated MMR further provides that you will “[g]et third party testing for silver ppm testing.(b)(4)ppm-(b)(4)ppm.” However, your response does not provide evidence this testing is being performed.
2. You failed to prepare and follow an MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, during the inspection, you stated that batch 30419A of your(b)(4)product was manufactured without an MMR. In addition, your MMR for “Bulk Silver Boost” failed to include all required information, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMR fails to include the following information:
• The identity and weight or measure of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)];• A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g);• Written instructions [21 CFR 111.210(h)], including the following:o Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)].1) Such specific actions must include verifying the weight or measure of any component and verifying the addition of any component [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(i)]; and
2) For manual operations, such specific actions must include [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)]:
A. One person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A)]; andB. One person adding the component and another person verifying the addition [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(B)].
We have received your response on December 9, 2019, in which you provided revised MMRs for your “Bulk Silver Boost,” “Bulk Humic Minerals,” “Bulk Fulvic Minerals,” “(b)(4),” and “(b)(4).” However, it appears that these documents have not been reviewed and approved by your quality control unit. In addition, the revised MMRs fail to include all necessary components of the MMR as required by 21 CFR 111.210 including:
• The identity and weight or measurement of each dietary ingredient that will be declared on the Supplement Facts label and the identity of each ingredient that will be declared on the ingredients list of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.210(d)].• A description of packaging and representative label, or cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)].• Written procedure for sampling and cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)].• Written instructions for specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement including, for manual operations one person weighing or measuring a component and another person verifying the weight or measure [21 CFR 111.210(h)(3)(ii)(A)].
3. You failed to establish a batch production record (BPR) that satisfies the requirements of 21 CFR 111.255 and 111.260. Specifically:
• Your BPR fails to accurately follow the appropriate MMR, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(c). You provided an MMR titled “Master Manufacturing Record For Bulk Silver Boost,” which states, “This procedure should yield(b)(4)Gallons of(b)(4)ppm Colloidal Silver.” However, the BPRs related to the MMR you provided to our investigator for Silver Boost Colloidal Silver batch numbers 10719A, 20519A, and 22719A show the respective batches produced(b)(4)gallons in(b)(4)eight-ounce units,(b)(4)gallons in(b)(4)eight-ounce units, and(b)(4)gallons in(b)(4)eight-ounce units.
• Your BPRs for Silver Boost 8 oz (batches 10719A, 20519A, and 22719A) failed to include:o The unique identifier that you assigned to each component and label [21 CFR 111.260(d)]. For your colloidal silver batches 10719A, 20519A, and 22719A, your BPRs fail to contain a unique identifier for(b)(4)silver and labels;o Documentation, at the time of performance, of packaging and labeling operations, including:
1) The unique identifier that you assigned to packaging and labels used, the quantity of the packaging and labels used, and, when label reconciliation is required, reconciliation of any discrepancies between issuance and use of labels [21 CFR 111.260(k)(1)];2) An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the MMR [21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)]; and3) The results of any tests or examinations conducted on packaged and labeled dietary supplements (including repackaged or relabeled dietary supplements), or a cross-reference to the physical location of such results [21 CFR 111.260(k)(3)];
o Documentation at the time of performance that quality control personnel:
1) Reviewed the BPR, including:
A. Review of any monitoring operation required under subpart E of this part [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(i)]; andB. Review of the results of any tests and examinations, including tests and examinations conducted on components, in-process materials, finished batches of dietary supplements, and packaged and labeled dietary supplements [21 CFR 111.260(l)(1)(ii)];
2) Approved or rejected any reprocessing or repackaging [21 CFR 111.260(l)(2)];
3) Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch [21 CFR 111.260(l)(3)]; and
4) Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement, including any repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.260(l)].
o Documentation at the time of performance of any required material review and disposition decision [21 CFR 111.260(m)].o Documentation at the time of performance of any reprocessing [21 CFR 111.260(n)].
You also informed our investigator you did not complete the BPRs used in the manufacturing, packing, and labeling of these products during the time of actual performance and production.We acknowledge receipt of your response on December 9, 2019, which provides an updated MMR reflecting the change in your operations to produce(b)(4)-gallon batches of bulk silver instead of the(b)(4)-gallon batches that were observed during the inspection. However, you did not provide BPRs demonstrating that the changes in operations have been carried forward into your actual operations. In addition, you indicated that you would be providing additional training, but you failed to provide a timeline of when the training would be completed, nor did you explain how such training would specifically address this deviation or prevent it from recurring.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your(b)(4),(b)(4), Energy Boost 70, and Silver Boost products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your Energy Boost 70 product in 1 fluid gallon (1 fl. gallon) (3.785 liter) and 4 fl. ounce (oz) units and(b)(4)each appears to be misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(s)(2)(A) and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§343(s)(2)(A) and 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the label fails to list the name of each dietary ingredient of the supplements that are described in section 201(ff) and the quantity of each such dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 101.36. For example, your labels suggest that the product contains several dietary ingredients. However, these dietary ingredients and their quantitative amounts by weight per serving are not listed in the Supplement Facts label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).
2. Your Energy Boost 70 product in 1 fl. gallon (3.785 liter) and 4 fl. oz units are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labels is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. The directions states: “For other needs up to 2 oz (60 ml)…three times a day or as directed by your health care professional” but the serving size is listed as “1 oz.” The serving size should be “2 oz (60 ml).”
In addition, your Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 4 fl oz and 8 fl oz products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size of “1 tbsp” declared in the Supplement Facts label is not consistent with the label statement of “…hold 1 teaspoon under tongue for 1 minute then swallow …”
Also, your(b)(4)product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] in that the Supplement Facts label fails to declare the serving size in the equivalent metric quantity in milliliters.3. Your Energy Boost 70 1 fl. gallon and 4 fl. Oz.,(b)(4), and(b)(4)products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] because the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9. For example,
• The labels declare Calories and Calories from fat but does not provide a quantitative weight or percent Daily Value (DV) as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2). However, if calories and saturated fat is not present or in an amount that can be declared as zero in 21 CFR 101.9(c), it shall not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).• The labels for your Energy Boost 70 products do not meet the requirement of 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(A) in that the “Amount per serving” heading is not centered over a column of quantitative amounts. Furthermore, a light bar fails to be placed below the heading “Amount per Serving” and “% DV” (21 CFR 101.36(e)(7)).• The labels for your Energy Boost 70 products,(b)(4), and(b)(4)product bear the title, “Supplement Facts,” in an incorrect format. The title, “Supplement Facts,” shall be set in a type size larger than all other print size in the nutrition label and, unless impractical, shall be set full width of the nutrition labels as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(1).• The labels for your Energy Boost 70 products fail to include a heavy bar beneath the last (b)(2) - dietary ingredient and beneath the last (b)(3) – dietary ingredient (other dietary ingredient), as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6)(ii) and (iii).• The labels for your Energy Boost 70 products lists the “Other ingredients” in the (b)(3)-dietary ingredient section within the Supplement Facts label. The “Ingredients” or “Other Ingredients” must be listed outside and immediately following the Supplement Facts label as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).• The labels for your Energy Boost 70 products fail to place a “*” following the quantitative amount of the “fulvic minerals 100% in solution” as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(iv).
4. Your Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 4 oz product is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the number of servings is incorrect.
5. Your(b)(4)and(b)(4)product labels are each misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(1)] in that each fails to declare the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
6. Your(b)(4)product label is misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.4 and 21 CFR 101.36.The product is manufactured into capsules, but the product label fails to list the ingredients used to form the capsules.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct all the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. The Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 4 oz product incorrectly declares “This 8 fl oz bottle makes 320 fl oz of 5 ppm product.” This the same statement that appears on the Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 8 oz product.
2. The Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 4 oz and 8 oz product labels bear “Directions: Mix ½ fl oz with 20 fl oz …” We suggest the term “½ fl oz” should be consistent with the serving size declared in the Supplement Facts label, e.g., 1 TBSP (1/2 fl oz)(15 ml).
3. The Silver Boost Colloidal Silver 4 oz and 8 oz,(b)(4), and(b)(4)labels declare “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet. We note this statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
4. The(b)(4)Supplement Facts label contains intervening material in addition to the name of (b)(3)-dietary ingredients which is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.2(d).
5. The Energy Boost 70 and(b)(4)product labels contain the FDA disclaimer statement but not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b)-(d). Intervening material should not be included within the FDA disclaimer. In addition, the symbol that links the disclaimer does not appear elsewhere on the label with a section 403(r)(6) of the Act statement.
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation, such as photographs, corrective actions taken to date, or other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs mean all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the inspection and assessing and collecting the inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.

WARNING LETTER
May 21, 2020
Reference: CMS #604298
Dear Mr. Houser:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility located at 6080 McDonough Drive, Suite A, Norcross, GA from November 5 - December 11, 2019. During the inspection, our investigators also collected and reviewed labeling for your products. Based on the inspectional findings and subsequent review of your product labels, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage at www.fda.gov.
At the close of the inspection, you were issued an FDA Form 483, Inspectional Observations. We acknowledge receipt of your written response, dated January 2, 2020. We have reviewed your response and discuss your significant violations and your corrective actions below.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplement products are adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements found in 21 CFR Part 111. During the inspection, we observed the following significant violations of the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to approve or reject all processes, specifications, controls, test and examinations that may affect the identity, purity, strength, or composition of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.105(a). Specifically, in the manufacture of the dietary supplement(b)(4), manufactured November 20, 2019, you increased from(b)(4)mg per serving the contents of the ingredient(b)(4), but the change in specifications was not reviewed or approved by quality control. Additionally, in manufacture of your(b)(4), manufactured November 6, 2019, you changed suppliers for your(b)(4)ingredient, which resulted in a change in the ingredient from(b)(4)per serving to(b)(4)per serving in the finished product, but the change in specifications was not reviewed or approved by quality control.
Your quality control personnel also failed to perform operations that ensure your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.105. During the inspection, a review of the finished product label and BPR for(b)(4), lot number(b)(4)found that the ingredients listed on the product label are not consistent with the Batch Production Record (BPR). The BPR indicates the lot was manufactured with the ingredients(b)(4). However, these ingredients are not declared on the product label you use for this product.1
In your written response, dated January 2, 2020, you provided a new Standard Operating Procedure, “BPR Circulation,” and a training record which addressed the requirements for quality control review and approval of BPRs for stages in the manufacturing process. However, you did not provide supporting documentation, such as an executed BPR, to demonstrate the implementation of the revised procedures. You also provided a revised Standard Operating Procedure PKG‐40‐002, “How to Use and Document a Deviation Record.” Your SOP states, “A second qualified person will check all(b)(4)and proposed instructions and sign and date as the approver in the appropriate space at the top of the record”; however, it is unclear whether the SOP includes a step for quality control review and signoff of the deviation form at this critical(b)(4)of production.
2. You failed to determine whether component specifications other than identity established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). Under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2), you must either conduct appropriate tests or examinations or rely on a certificate of analysis (COA) from the supplier of the component that you receive, provided that the COA meets specific requirements. You receive dietary ingredients, including botanical ingredients from domestic and international suppliers, and you do not typically perform any heavy metal testing, choosing instead to rely on the results of your suppliers’ COAs. However, you may only rely on a COA from a supplier of the component if the following conditions are met: (A) you first qualify the supplier by establishing the reliability of the supplier's COA through confirmation of the results of the supplier's tests or examinations; (B) the COA includes a description of the test or examination method(s) used, limits of the test or examinations, and actual results of the tests or examinations; (C) you maintain documentation of how you qualified the supplier; (D) you periodically reconfirm the supplier's COA; and (E) your quality control personnel review and approve the documentation setting forth the basis for qualification (and re‐qualification) of any supplier. You have not qualified any suppliers by confirming the reliability of the COA.
In your written response, dated January 2, 2020, you stated your plans to draft and release a new Standard Operating Procedure for implementing a vendor verification program by January 20, 2020. You further stated that by February 29, 2020, you were going to engage a(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of this corrective action, as you have not provided a copy of the new SOP or other supporting documentation. Additionally, your plan to address this issue with regard to botanicals already received is unclear.
3. Your firm’s MMR did not include a representative label, or cross reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g). Specifically, the MMRs for your(b)(4)did not include a representative label or reference to the physical location of the label.
In your written response, dated January 2, 2020, you provided a new Standard Operating Procedure ADM‐00‐015, “Master Manufacturing Record Preparation,” which addresses the step for inclusion of a representative label in the MMR. You stated that NutraCap will complete personnel training and the update of all MMRs by March 31, 2020; however, you have not provided such documentation for our review. Therefore, we are unable to evaluate the sufficiency of your corrective action.
4. You failed to suitably dispose of labels and packaging for dietary supplements that are obsolete or incorrect to ensure that they are not used in any future packaging and labeling operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.415(h). Specifically, during the inspection, on November 21, 2019, and December 4, 2019, our investigators observed different boxes of dietary supplement labels that were no longer in use in the labeling room, near the production warehouse, which could potentially cause mix‐up and use in manufacturing.
In your response, dated January 2, 2020, you reported that NutraCap will draft a new Standard Operating Procedure by January 20, 2020, for disposition of labeling rolls containing(b)(4)product labels and requirements for labeling rolls containing(b)(4)product labels. However, you have not provided a copy of your SOP or training records; therefore, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of these corrective actions.Adulterated Dietary Supplements: Unsafe Food Additive
Your(b)(4)are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because they contain 2-amino-5-methylheptane (DMHA), an unsafe food additive under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 348(a)]. If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.2Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(C)(i)].
The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. DMHA does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)] because it is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types. Neither is DMHA GRAS under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement product. Because DMHA does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your(b)(4)products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because they contain an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].3
This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for ensuring that your facility operates in compliance with the Act and other applicable laws. You should take prompt action to correct the violations noted in this letter. Failure to do so may result in regulatory action by the FDA without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act (21 USC 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA's costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA's arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen working days of the receipt of this letter as to the specific steps you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations. In your response, you should include documentation, including revised procedures, results of tests you have conducted, and other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If the corrective actions cannot be completed within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time frame within which the corrections will be implemented.
Your written response should be sent to Patricia F. Hudson, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 8th Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309.

RE: Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.drrimatruthreports.com, www.opensourcetruth.com, www.truthaboutcoronavirus.com, and www.nsfmarketplace.com on March 11, 2020 and May 6, 2020, respectively. Your websites www.drrimatruthreports.com, www.opensourcetruth.com, and www.TruthAboutCoronavirus.com direct consumers to www.nsfmarketplace.com to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website www.nsfmarketplace.com offers a line of “Dr. Rima RecommendsTM Nano Silver 10 PPM” products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191 in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2 In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3 Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:

You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations. It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not representing your products for a COVID-19 related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours,please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force- CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov describing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA's website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found at www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
If you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) listed above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States. Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above.Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Mr. Cleland at202-326-3088.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Ms. and Mr. Borten:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 12011 NE Marx Street, Portland, Oregon, from August 12, 2019, through August 21, 2019. Based on the inspection and a review of your product labels and your websites, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and related regulations through links in FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
We received your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection and items discussed with you during the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Although you intend to market CBD Inflammation Relief, CBD Headache Relief, and CBD Sleep Support as dietary supplements, FDA has concluded that based on available evidence that CBD products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)]. Further, FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)]. Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355], or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.1There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary substance definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii)], but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue. For more information on FDA’s regulation of CBD products, see our webpage at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/public-health-focus/fdaregulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-including-cannabidiol-cbd.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your websites at the internet addresses https://dragontreeapothecary.com and https://dragontreecbd.com in April 2020, and has determined that you take orders there for Cold & Flu Relief, Inflammation Relief, Anxiety Relief, Sleep Support, Muscle Melt Liniment, Muscle Melt Balm, Muscle Melt Patch, CBD Headache Relief, CBD Sleep Support, and CBD Muscle Melt Balm. FDA also reviewed your product labels collected during the August 2019, inspection. The claims on your product labels and websites establish that your products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or function of the body.
Examples of some of the claims on your websites and product labels that provide evidence your products are intended for use as drugs include the following:

CBD Muscle Melt Balm
Statement that appears on the website, https://dragontreecbd.com:
“[S]oothe uncomfortable muscles and joints more quickly and safely than oral pharmaceuticals”
Your Cold & Flu Relief, Inflammation Relief, Anxiety Relief, Sleep Support, Muscle Melt Liniment, Muscle Melt Balm, Muscle Melt Patch, CBD Headache Relief, CBD Sleep Support, and CBD Muscle Melt Balm products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, they are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDA-approved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
In addition, your Inflammation Relief product is misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (See 21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. The aforementioned product is offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use this drug safely for its intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your product is not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for use, 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA-approved application is in effect for it. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
We note that we received your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, in which you stated that you have retained legal counsel to assist in a comprehensive review of product claims and that you anticipated having the review and revisions to marketing materials completed by April 6, 2020. To date we have received no communication from your firm about this issue.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your dietary supplement products are adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for dietary supplements (21 CFR Part 111). Additionally, even if your Sleep Support, Anxiety Relief, Cold & Flu Relief, and Inflammation Relief products did not have therapeutic claims that make them drugs, these products would be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements.
During the inspection, we found the following violations of CGMP requirements for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to establish specifications for your dietary supplements in accordance with, 21 CFR 111.70, such as the following:
a. Identity specifications for each component that you used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1);
b. Component specifications, for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, that are necessary to ensure that the specifications for the purity, strength and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2); and
c. Product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e).
Specifically, during the inspection our investigator asked if specifications have been established for ingredients used to manufacture the supplements, any in-process steps affecting the quality of the supplements, the finished supplement products, packaging components like bottles and caps, and labels for the finished product. Your Apothecary Director stated that there is a recipe for each product, but specifications have not been established for finished products, ingredients, bottles and caps, or in-process parameters.
We reviewed your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, which states you are in discussion with two potential consulting firms. While we acknowledge the action of using a consulting firm to assist you in developing your quality system, your response did not provide any interim measures you were planning to take before your anticipated completion date of April 6, 2020, nor have we received a communication from your firm as it relates to this matter after your anticipated completion date.
2. You did not prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of your dietary supplements that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity of the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, your firm has not established a written MMR that includes the identity specifications for any points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary and to establish controls and procedures to ensure that each batch of dietarysupplement that you manufacture meets such specifications. During the inspection, your Apothecary Director stated there has not been any master manufacturing records created to meet the requirements because they did not understand that the requirements were so specific for manufacturing dietary supplements.
We reviewed your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, which stated that you were planning to hire a consulting firm to assist you in developing your quality system. However, to date we have received no information upon which to evaluate whether you have taken corrective actions.
3. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection, the Apothecary Director provided the investigator a document titled “Quality Control” in response to the investigator’s request for your written quality control procedures. However, this document does not satisfy the requirementsfor quality control as listed in 21 CFR 111, Subpart F, including:
a. Ensuring that required representative samples and reserve samples are collected and held (21 CFR 111.105(f) and (g));
b. Requirements for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision (21 CFR 111.113);
c. Quality control operations for equipment, instruments and controls (21 CFR 111.117);
d. Quality control operations for components, packaging and labeling (21 CFR 111.120);
e. Quality control operations for MMRs, batch production records, and manufacturing operations (21 CFR 111.123);
f. Quality control operations for returned dietary supplements, including any dietary supplement that is reprocessed (21 CFR 111.130);
We reviewed your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, in which you state you are using a consulting firm to assist you in developing your quality control operations. However, to date we have received no information upon which to evaluate whether you have taken corrective actions.
4. You failed to establish and follow written procedures to fulfill the requirements of this Subpart O (Product Complaints), as required by 21 CFR 111.553.Specifically, during the inspection, the Apothecary Director provided our investigator with an untitled written procedure document, with a subsection titled “Complaints,” in response to the investigator’s request for your written complaint procedures. However, this document does not provide a procedure to have quality control personnel review and approve decisions about whether to investigate a product complaint and review and approve the findings and followup action of any investigation performed (see 21 CFR 111.560).
We reviewed your email correspondence dated September 5, 2019, in which you stated you are using a consulting firm to assist you in developing your complaint procedures. However, to date we have received no information upon which to evaluate whether you have taken corrective actions.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, but not limited to, seizure and/or injunction.
Additionally, we have the following comment. Under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of the dietary ingredient prior to its use. As explained previously in this letter, you need to establish identity specifications for components in your dietary supplements, including dietary ingredients. During the inspection, the Apothecary Director explained to the investigator that botanical ingredients received in plant form undergo visual examination and(b)(4)exams such as(b)(4)and(b)(4). However, your firm has no records of these examinations. Your Apothecary Director also explained that powdered ingredients undergo organoleptic examination. While organoleptic analysis may be an appropriate identity test for whole or coarsely-cut botanical parts, it may not be an appropriate identity test for powdered or extracted botanicals because of decreased reliability, or in those instances where misidentification of botanicals is known to occur. Organoleptic testing has limitations and may not be adequate or appropriate for verifying the identity of dietary ingredients in powder form in contrast to whole herbs or botanicals.
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.
Your firm’s response should be sent to: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington 98021, to the attention of CDR Joshua Wireman, Compliance Officer. If you have any questions regarding this letter, please contact CDR Wireman at425-302-0345.

1CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See Sativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer Pain and GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.

WARNING LETTER 599467
Dear Mr. Moyar:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 1632 Enterprise Parkway, Suite F, Twinsburg, Ohio on November 25 through December 11, 2019. During the inspection, we collected labeling for your ORËÁ product and reviewed your website at Internet address www.lhscience.com, where you take orders for your ORËÁ product. Based on inspectional findings and a review of your website, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s Internet home page athttp://www.fda.gov
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA has subsequently reviewed your website at the Internet address www.lhscience.com in March 2020 and has determined you take orders there for your ORËÁ product. The claims on your website establish the product is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21United States Code(USC) § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your product, ORËÁ, is intended for use as a drug include:
“ORËÁ was developed to create a safe and effective way to support the body's natural ability to remove toxins . . . .If you’re experiencing problems sleeping . . .headaches . . . toxic build-up could be the culprit.""
“ORËÁ helps remove heavy metals, biotoxins, solvents, pesticides, and chemicals that can contribute to body aches and pains.""
“ORËÁ works at the cellular level to help remove harmful toxins from the body . . .”
“ORËÁ is an all-natural detoxification system designed to restore your health and vitality like no other cleanse can . . . . Symptoms of Toxin Accumulation . . . include: . . . Forgetfulness/Mental Confusion, Mood Changes/Mild Depression, Anxiety . . . Insomnia, Body Aches and Pains . . . Nausea, Vision Problems”
Your ORËÁ product is not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the product is a “new drug” under Section 201(p) of the Act [21 USC § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 USC §§ 331(d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 USC § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your ORËÁ product is intended for prevention or treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purpose. Accordingly, ORËÁ fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 USC § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations/Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Even if your ORËÁ product did not have therapeutic claims that make it an unapproved new drug and misbranded drug, our investigator observed the following violation(s) of the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements for dietary supplements, Title 21,Code of Federal Regulations(CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR 111), which render your products adulterated dietary supplements within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 342(g)(1)] for the reasons described below.
We received your response dated January 6, 2020, addressing the FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to your firm. Inadequacies in your response are addressed below.
1. You did not establish product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you did not have finished product specifications for identity, purity, strength, and composition of your ORËÁ dietary supplement product.
We have reviewed your January 6, 2020, response. Your response stated you received information on the element composition of your finished product from a third-party analysis and determined finished product strength via(b)(4). You provided the analysis from the third-party laboratory for the raw material and for the finished product. You claim that the company “utilizes the same manufacturing process to make the product today.” However, you still have not provided any documentation that establishes in-progress specifications for each step of the manufacturing process, nor have you explained why the values for the raw material analysis are different from the values for the finished product or how you ensure that the same values are achieved each time a batch is produced. Your response also does not provide documentation stating product specifications with a target yield of the finished product and the allowable variance from the target yield. You have not provided documentation with actual specifications against which you could compare a final certificate of analysis. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you have not provided supporting documentation that you have taken corrective action by establishing finished product specifications.
2. You failed to establish component specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b), for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. For example:
You did not establish component identity specifications; you did not establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of dietary supplements manufactured using the component are met; for your component(b)(4), you did not establish limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1), 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2), and 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Specifically, you failed to establish component specifications to qualify the Certificate of Analysis (COA) received from your supplier of(b)(4), lot number(b)(4), you currently use to manufacture your ORËÁ dietary supplement product.
You did not establish component specifications for the limits of contamination regarding the(b)(4)your firm uses to manufacture dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(3). Specifically, you test the(b)(4)used as a component in your ORËÁ dietary supplement product for total dissolved solids (TDS); however, you have not established specifications to determine the satisfactory range for TDS present in the(b)(4)nor have you established specifications for other limits on contamination which may be associated with this component.
We have reviewed your January 6, 2020 response. Your response stated you had a third-party laboratory analyze the referenced(b)(4)on(b)(4). This analysis provided the values of “(b)(4)” Element “(b)(4)” that were present in this material which were provided. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because these values do not represent component product specifications in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70.
3. Your firm’s batch production records (BPRs) did not include all information required in a BPR, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. Your batch production record must include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b). For example, your batch production records for your ORËÁ dietary supplement product, lot numbers Lot #(b)(4), and Lot #(b)(4), did not include the following:
Regarding Lot #(b)(4):
The actual results obtained during any monitoring operation, including the actual temperatures during the “(b)(4)” steps during Production 1 [21 CFR 111.260(g)];
An actual or representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label specified in the master manufacturing record [21 CFR 111.260(k)(2)]
We have reviewed your January 6, 2020 response. You stated original raw data was recorded on(b)(4)and(b)(4)will be performed to ensure this information will be included on(b)(4)in the future. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions because you did not provide documentation of revised batch records.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements:
In addition, your ORËÁ product is a misbranded dietary supplement under Section 403 of the Act [21 USC § 343] because it does not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101 as follows:
1. Your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 USC § 343(y)] in that the product label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.2. Your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343(q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of the products does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36.For example:
Your product label fails to include the “Servings Per Container” per 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
Your product label bears the statement “Percent Daily Values are based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein, as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D). None of these dietary ingredients is present on the label, so the statement is not permitted.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of the Act and implementing regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action such as seizure or injunction.
In addition, we also offer the following comments:
1. Your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units’ labels contains the FDA disclaimer statement. However, this disclaimer is not linked to any specific structure function claim on the product label. The FDA disclaimer statement as noted on your product label must be bolded and set off in a box, and the symbol preceding the disclaimer statement must be linked to the same symbol placed at the end of each structure function statement on the label in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(d) and (e).
2. Your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units’ labels fails to include the correct unit fluid ounce ""fl oz"" in according 21 CFR 101.07(j)(3).
3. For your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units’ labels, the “other ingredients list” must be placed below the Supplement Facts label, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).
4. Your ORËÁ product in 30 milliliter (ml) and 60 ml units’ labels lists the chemical preservatives sodium benzoate and potassium sorbate but do not bear labeling stating that fact, in that the label fails to include a separate description of their function as a preservative in accordance with 21 CFR 101.22(j).Please respond to this office in writing within 15 working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific steps you are taking or have taken to correct the violations, including an explanation of how your firm plans to prevent these violations from occurring again and copies of related documentation. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete the corrective actions within 15 working days, state the reason for the delay and the time in which you will complete the corrections.
Section 743 of the Act [21 USC 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 USC 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspected noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection related costs.
Your reply should be addressed to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; Attn: Zada L. Giles, Compliance Officer, via email at ORAHAFEAST5FirmResponses@fda.hhs.gov or at 404 BNA Drive, Suite 500, Nashville, TN 37217.

CC:                regulatory-inquiries@amazon.com –   Amazon Associates Program
RE:                Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.cbdgaze.com on May 7, 2020 and May 21, 2020, respectively.  While reviewing your website, FDA observed that you participate in the Amazon Associates program.  As an Amazon associate, you earn commissions by promoting the sale of CBD products including Restorative Botanicals Ultra High Strength Hemp Oil Supplement and Serenity Hemp Liquid Dietary Supplement  (hereinafter referred to as “Amazon associate products”)[1]with claims on your website representing or implying that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[2]in people.  Based on our review, these claims cause the Amazon associate products purchased through links on your website to be unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a).  Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352.  Causing the introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).  In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being misbranded.
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2).  The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[3]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[4]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people.  As described above, you promote and participate in the sale of products for use in mitigating, preventing, treating, diagnosing, or curing COVID-19 in people, as evidenced by the claims from your website quoted below.  We request that you immediately cease promoting and participating in the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your website www.cbdgaze.com that establish the intended use of your Amazon associate products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
“Find the best CBD Oil to help fight Coronavirus.”
“Use CBD Oil to fight coronavirus, COVID-19!”
“Let the power of CBD help you combat your illness, covid-19, coronavirus…”
You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter.  This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your activities as an Amazon associate do not violate the FD&C Act.  We advise you to review your websites and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure thatyou are not misleadingly representing your Amazon associate products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours, please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.govdescribing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19.  Your firm will be added to a published list onFDA’swebsite of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act.  This list can be found athttp://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products.Once you have taken corrective actionsto cease promoting the sale of unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19,and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections.  If you believe that your Amazon associate products and activities are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.  For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above.  Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  You must immediately cease making all such claims.  Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns. If you have any questions regarding compliance with the FTC Act, please contact Mr. Cleland at202-326-3088.

Warning Letter
Dear Mrs. Bailey:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 109 Barnes Avenue, Carrollton, Mississippi from July 15-19, 2019. During the inspection we collected your product labeling for your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product. Based on our inspection and subsequent review of your product labeling, including product labeling collected during the inspection, and subsequent review of your website at https://www.humaworm.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address https://www.humaworm.com in March 2020, and has determined that you take orders there for the products Humaworm Parasite Cleanse, Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children, and Candida & Fungi Cleanse. The claims on your website and on your product labeling for Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.Examples of some of the claims on your website, https://www.humaworm.com, that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Home page:• “We are a family run business that specializes in the creation of herbal formulas for the removal of parasites. . .”
Questions & Answers tab:• “Do I need to change my diet for HUMAWORM to be more effective?
No – HUMAWORM will work regardless of what you eat. You do need to drink at least 2 quarts of water every day during the cleanse to keep the parasites and toxins flushing out of your body.”
• “When will it take effect?
HUMAWORM will begin working the first day, however you will begin to feel the effects within 2-3 days. Most parasites are removed during the first 7 days. The rest of the parasites, their larvae and eggs are removed in the next 23 days. Due to the life cycle of a parasite and their ability to migrate throughout the body, it is essential to take the full 30 day dose, even after you’re feeling GREAT!”
• “I have not seen any worms. Is it working?
Yes, if you’re taking HUMAWORM as directed, it’s working. Remember that 70% of parasites are microscopic and not everyone will see visible parasites during the cleanse. Judge the effectiveness by the way you feel overall and take HUMAWORM for the full 30 days, even if you feel GREAT after just a week or two.”
• “I feel like I have the flu! Why????
This is from your body detoxing. HUMAWORM is removing parasites. . .”
Parasite Facts and Figures tab:• “PARASITE FACTS AND FIGURES
There are four classifications of parasites. 30% live in our digestive systems while the other 70% live all over our bodies including, the blood, and all organs including the brain and even in our eyes and sinus cavities. There are over 1,000 types of parasites in these four classes that can live in the human body.”
• “BACTERIA, VIRUSES and FUNGUS (mold, yeasts) are ALL in the very broad parasite category.”
• “The following is a partial list from each of the four groups which will give you the general idea about how different parasites wreak havoc on our bodies. . .
NAEGLERIA – this one is found in water and soil, but only one species – naegleria fowleri – can infect humans. The infection mimics bacterial meningitis and affects the brain and spinal cord. . . Infection causes Primary Amebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM), a brain inflammation, which leads to the destruction of brain tissue. . .
MALARIA . . .
CRYPTOSPORIDIUM . . . The infection is called Cryptosporidiosis – also known as crypto. . . They are ideal carriers for many of our autoimmune diseases. During the past 2 decades, crypto has become recognized as one of the most common causes of waterborne disease within humans in the United States. It may be found in drinking water and recreational water in EVERY REGION of the United States AND throughout the WORLD. The most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include dehydration, weight loss, stomach cramps and/or pain, fever, nausea and vomiting. . .
AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS – also called Chagas Disease is an infection caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. . . symptoms include cardiac problems, swollen esophagus and/or swollen large bowel.
TUBERCULOSIS . . .
LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS – . . . people with this parasite will have more bacterial infections. . .
E COLI . . .
LISTERIA. . .
TRICHINELLA. . .SPIROCHETE – this parasite is carried by lice, ticks, fleas, mites and flying biting insects who all transmit them to humans. They cause relapsing fever, jaundice, Lyme disease, Vincent angina and Wyles disease. . .
PINWORMS . . .
HOOKWORMS. . . In the lungs they can cause pneumonia. In the intestines they hook themselves into the intestinal walls where each one drinks up to 1cc of blood per day causing bleeding and tissue death, not to mention anemia weakness. . . Hookworms also cause asthma, eye pain, insomnia, and dry skin and hair. . . While a light infection may cause no symptoms, heavy infection can cause anemia, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and weight loss. Heavy, chronic infections can cause stunted growth and mental development. . .
BAYLISASCARIS. . . The symptoms – which can take a week or more to show – include nausea, fatigue, liver enlargement, loss of coordination and loss of muscle control. Severe cases can cause blindness and coma.
SCHISTOSOMIASIS. . . Days after infection, itchy skin or a rash develops – after 1-2 months, fever, chills, cough and muscle aches set in. . . The eggs can be found in the brain, spinal cord and can cause seizures, spinal cord inflammation and paralysis. The parasite can damage the liver, intestines, lungs and bladder. . .
. . . infection is called CYSTICERCOSIS. When the cysticerci are found in the brain, the condition is called neurocysticercosis. . . Signs and symptoms of infection will depend on how many there are and where in the body they are located. You may feel lumps in the muscles, under the skin. They may float in the eyes causing blurry or disturbed vision. They can also cause swelling of the eyes. In the brain, they cause headaches and seizures – they also cause confusion, lack of attention, balance difficulties and swelling of the brain (hydrocephalus). Heavy infections can cause sudden death.
FISH TAPEWORM. . . It causes anemia, water retention and weight gain as it makes the host uncontrollably hungry.
Alveolar Echinococcosis. . . infection in humans causes parasitic tumors to form in the liver, and, less commonly, the lungs, brain, and other organs. If left untreated, infection with AE can be fatal. . . Symptoms may mimic those of liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.”How We Get Parasites tab:
• “If after reading this section you’re thinking ‘If parasite eggs are everywhere and are so easy to obtain, then why aren’t we ALL infected?’ The answer? 90% of us ALREADY ARE. Here are some examples of how easily you can become a parasite host . . .”
• “HOW & WHY PARASITES MAKE US SICK
Before you read over the following list of symptoms, you need to understand how and why parasites make us sick. Parasites are the HIDDEN DISEASE, they can occur ANYWHERE in the body, in EVERY organ, in ALL tissues, and in the blood. Parasites can cause problems that mimic other disorders and are not diagnosed as being parasite related.”
Symptoms tab:• “Some Symptoms of Parasite Infections
STOMACH & INTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS – The sheer number of parasites in the lower digestive system and the toxic waste produced by them can cause these problems: Diarrhea[,] Chronic Constipation . . .”
“SKIN DISORDERS & ALLERGIES – Parasites that penetrate the skin cause itching. When tissue becomes inflamed from these parasites, the body’s white blood cells increase to defend the body. . . Symptoms include: . . . Allergies . . . Allergic Reactions to Food. . .”
De-Worming Humans tab:• “Modern medicine and chemicals used to treat worms are formulated to rid the body of only one type of parasite at a time. Parasites easily migrate to a different part of the body that’s not being treated. Herbal treatments work differently.”
• “HERBAL REMEDIES FOR PARASITE REMOVAL
There are two schools of thought on herbal parasite removal. . . The second school of thought is what HUMAWORM is based on. We have found that a milder dose of parasite killing herbs over a longer period of time is the MOST EFFECTIVE way to rid your entire body of parasites and their toxins. Your body does not go into shock – and all parasites, larvae and eggs are removed over a thirty day period. Most parasites are destroyed within the first week of treatment, however, the remaining larvae and eggs are removed in the next twenty-three days. Parasites will try to migrate to any part of the body that is not being treated so they can stay with you – their host. The HUMAWORM FORMULA treats the entire body so there is NOWHERE for them to hide.”
Order Products tab:• “Humaworm Parasite Cleanse”
• “Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children”
• “Candida & Fungi Cleanse”
CANDIDA & FUNGI CLEANSE tab:• “CANDIDA & FUNGI CLEANSE”
• “Candida yeast infections are more common today than they have ever been!”
• “When the yeast strain CANDIDA is allowed to overgrow in the body it can cause major problems such as: . . . yeast infections in both men & women. . .athlete’s foot. . .thrush in the mouth and on the genital area. . .”
• “FUNGI overgrowth causes: . . .respiratory problems. . .allergic reaction problems…”
Examples of some of the claims on your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product labeling that provide evidence that this product is intended for use as a drug include:
• “This formula is formulated & promoted as a Whole Body Parasite Cleanse.”• “Taking Humaworm for Adults before eating will ensure that the parasites will get a good belly full of parasite killing herbs instead of thriving off your good nutrition!!!”
Your products Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”), Humaworm Parasite Cleanse, Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children, and Candida & Fungi Cleanse are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”), Humaworm Parasite Cleanse, and Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”), Humaworm Parasite Cleanse, and Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
We note that your product Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) is not labeled as a dietary supplement, and therefore does not meet the definition of a dietary supplement. See section 201(ff)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(2)(C)]. However, we note that your product labeling contains a statement that closely resembles the statement required under section 403(r)(6)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(r)(6)(C)] for dietary supplements that make certain labeling claims. Based on your use of this statement, it appears you may intend to market your product Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) as a dietary supplement. Even if this product was properly labeled as a dietary supplement, and even if this product and your Humaworm Parasite Cleanse, Humaworm Parasite Cleanse For Children, and Candida & Fungi Cleanse products were not unapproved new drugs or misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements in 21 Code of Federal Regulations Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111).
1. You failed to establish specifications required by 21 CFR 111.70. Specifically:
a. You failed to establish specifications for dietary supplement labels (label specifications) and for packaging that may come in contact with dietary supplements (packaging specifications), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). Specifically, you did not establish label specifications or packaging specifications for any of your dietary supplements. Packaging that may come into contact with dietary supplements must be safe and suitable for its intended use and must not be reactive or absorptive or otherwise affect the safety or quality of the dietary supplement.
b. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). In particular, you did not establish finished product specifications for any of your dietary supplements.
Once you have established specifications, you must determine whether the specifications are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95(b).
2. You failed to conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, prior to its use, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i). Specifically, you did not conduct any test or examination to verify the identity of any dietary ingredient prior to its use in manufacturing your dietary supplements.
3. You failed to implement quality control operations in your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations for producing the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (MMR), as required by 21 CFR 111.65. For example, during the inspection, our investigators observed that you did not follow your quality control written procedures, titled “Quality Control Requirements for the Production of Humaworm Dietary Supplements.”
4. You failed to prepare and follow a written MMR for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). For example, it was observed during the inspection that you did not have a written MMR for the Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product you manufacture. For each unique formulation of a dietary supplement you manufacture, you must prepare and follow an MMR that includes the information specified in 21 CFR 111.210.
5. You failed to prepare a batch production record every time you manufacture a batch of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). For example, it was observed during the inspection that you did not prepare a batch production record for the Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product you manufactured.
6. Your personnel failed to use hygienic practices to the extent necessary to protect against contamination of components, dietary supplements or contact surfaces, as required by 21 CFR 111.10(b). Specifically, during the inspection, an employee was observed scooping your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) powder into packaging bags with ungloved soiled hands, while wearing a soiled apron, unsecured personal jewelry, and no hairnet. This employee was observed storing food products for personal use in the processing room and admitted to our investigators that she eats in the processing room.
7. You failed to maintain, clean, and sanitize, as necessary, all equipment, utensils, and any other contact surfaces used to manufacture, package, label or hold components or dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.27(d). For example, on July 15, 2019, our investigators observed product residue on a manual capsule filler and processing table from a batch of another product that you said you manufactured on July 12, 2019.
8. You failed to take all necessary precautions during the manufacture of a dietary supplement to prevent contamination of components or dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.365. For example, you failed to perform manufacturing operations under conditions and controls that protect against the potential for growth of microorganisms and the potential for contamination, as required by 21 CFR 111.365(a). You also failed to perform mechanical manufacturing steps by any effective means to protect the dietary supplements against contamination, by, for example, cleaning and sanitizing contact surfaces, as required by 21 CFR 111.365(h).
9. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for fulfilling the requirements that apply to components of dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.153. Specifically, during the inspection it was observed that you did not identify each lot of components that you receive in a manner that allows you to trace the lot to the supplier, the date received, the name of the component, the status of the component (e.g., quarantined, approved, or rejected), and to the dietary supplement that you manufactured and distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.155(d)(1).
10. You failed to ensure that each person engaged in manufacturing, packaging, labeling or holding, or in performing any quality control operations, has the education, training, or experience to perform the person’s assigned functions, as required by 21 CFR 111.12(c). Specifically, you failed to ensure that employees are trained on the applicable dietary supplement CGMP requirements, as shown by your employee’s statement that she has not received training on CGMP requirements and by her failure to use hygienic practices to the extent necessary to protect against contamination of components, dietary supplements, and contact surfaces.
Furthermore, you must make and keep documentation of training, including the date of the training, the type of training, and the person(s) trained, as required by 21 CFR 111.14(b)(2).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product was not an unapproved new drug and a misbranded drug, and your product was properly labeled as a dietary supplement, your product would also be a misbranded dietary supplement under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343]. If you intend to market your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) products as a dietary supplement, our label review shows that this product is not properly labeled as a dietary supplement. If you intend to market your products as dietary supplements, they must comply with the applicable statutory and regulatory requirements for dietary supplements. If this product was a dietary supplement, it would be misbranded for the following reasons:
1. Your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the label fails to have supplement facts information as required by 21 CFR 101.36.
2. Your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (s)(2)(B)] because the label does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
3. Your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
4. Your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel as required by 21 CFR 101.7.
5. Your Humaworm for Adults Formula Bulk (aka “Humaworm (Bulk)”) product would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] because the label fails to declare the capsule ingredients as required by 21 CFR 101.4(a) and (g).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.

Re: 594850
Dear Mr. Villalobos:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 4102 Orange Ave, Ste 118 & 119, Long Beach, CA 90807 on September 24 and 30, 2019. Based on laboratory analysis of your product and a review of your product labeling, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements: Unsafe Food Additive
Your Skinny Pill product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(2)(C)(i)] because it contains 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA), an unsafe food additive under section 409(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 348(a)]. If a substance added to food is not generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by qualified experts for its intended use in food and does not qualify for any of the other exemptions from the food additive definition, it is a food additive.1Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(a)(C)(i)].
The definition of “food additive” in section 201(s) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(s)] does not include dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements as defined in section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 321(ff)(1)] or substances that are GRAS under the conditions of intended use. DMAA does not qualify as a dietary ingredient under section 201(ff)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(1)] because it is not a vitamin, mineral, amino acid, herb or other botanical, dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake, or concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any of the preceding dietary ingredient types. Neither is DMAA GRAS under its conditions of use in your dietary supplement product. Because DMAA does not qualify as a dietary ingredient and is not GRAS or otherwise exempt from the food additive definition, your Skinny Pill product is adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the Act because it contains an unsafe food additive. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food that is adulterated is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
The FDA recognizes that your firm voluntarily destroyed your inventory of Skinny Pill on September 24, 2019, and the product is no longer listed for sale on your website, www.losefatgainlifemb.com. FDA has also issued a warning to consumers not to use Skinny Pill (see Skinny Pill Immediate Public Notification).
Unapproved New Drug and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at www.losefatgainlifemb.com in March 2020 and has determined that you take order there for the products Reishi Coffee, Sugar Control, Blood Pressure Support, Fat Burner, Hear Clear Ear Health Formula, Hemp Oil, Liquid Gold, Omega 3, and Ovary Care. FDA also reviewed your Facebook page at www.facebook.com/LoseFatMB/ and your Instagram page at www.instagram.com/losefatgainlifembofficial in March 2020, which sites link to your website at www.losefatgainlifemb.com. The claims on your website, Facebook page, and Instagram page establish that your Reishi Coffee, Sugar Control, Blood Pressure Support, Fat Burner, Hear Clear Ear Health Formula, Hemp Oil, Liquid Gold, Omega 3, and Ovary Care are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the claims from your website at www.losefatgainlifemb.com that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
Reishi Coffee
“Helps: … Diabetes … Cancer cells … Urinary tract infections … Tumors”
Sugar Control
“Helps with: High blood sugar … Excess glucose in blood … Diabetic foot”
Blood Pressure Support
“Helps: … Control High Blood Pressure … Varicose veins … Hemorrhoids”
Fat Burner
“… [B]alancing blood sugar levels.”
“It also helps with … obesity, high blood pressure, chronic tiredness, and fatigue.”
Hear Clear Ear Health Formula
“Ayuda evitar infecciones y dolor” (English translation: “It helps prevent infections and pain”
“Ayuda a reducir el daño causado por la exposición al ruido” (English translation: “It helps reduce the damage caused by exposure to noise"")
Hemp Oil
“Helps Fight Cancer”
“Lower Risk of Diabetes”
“OCD”
“PTSD”
“Neurological disorders Such as schizophrenia”
Liquid Gold
“Asthma”
“Bronchitis”
Omega 3
“Helps with: Protecting against alzheimer’s [sic] disease[,] Rheumatoid arthritis[,] Cardiovascular diseases[,] High cholesterol[,] Decreasing inflammation[,] Reducing risk of stroke and heart attack”
An example of a claim on your Facebook page that establish that your products are intended for use as drugs includes:
On June 25, 2019, your company posted an image of your Hemp Oil product surrounded by the following language: “Benefits of Hemp Cannabidiol (CBD) …ANTIPSYCHOTIC Combats Psychosis Disorders[,] ANTI-OXIDANT Combats Neurodegenerative Disorders[,] ANXIOLYTIC/ANTIDEPRESSANT Combats Anxiety and Depression Disorders … ANTI-TUMOR/ANTI-CANCER Combats Tumor and Cancer Cells.” You caption this photo post with “Hemp Oil” and provide a link to your website where you offer this product for sale.
Examples of some of the claims on your Instagram page that establish that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
On September 28, 2019: “Ovary Care… Helps … Prevent ovarian cancer, Cysts in the ovaries, Polycystic ovary syndrome …Swelling in lower abdomen, Has anti-pasmodic action [sic]”
Your Instagram page also contains evidence of intended use in the form of the following personal testimonial recommending or describing the use of your Sugar Control for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. On July 4, 2019: “Le doy gracias a Dios Porke [sic] me ciento [sic] bien con mis productos después de tanto tiempo con esta condición de la diabetes de tenerla a 580 y antes de tomar sugar control la tenia 480 y ahora la tengo 344” (English translation: “I thank God because I feel good with my products after being with diabetes for a long time having it was at 580 and before taking sugar control, I had 480 and now I have 344”)
Your Reishi Coffee, Sugar Control, Blood Pressure Support, Fat Burner, Hear Clear Ear Health Formula, Hemp Oil, Liquid Gold, Omega 3, and Ovary Care products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 C.F.R. § 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products Reishi Coffee, Sugar Control, Blood Pressure Support, Fat Burner, Hemp Oil, Liquid Gold, Omega 3, and Ovary Care are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, Reishi Coffee, Sugar Control, Blood Pressure Support, Fat Burner, Hemp Oil, Liquid Gold, Omega 3, and Ovary Care fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Your written reply should be directed to Aaron Dotson, United States Food and Drug Administration, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, 5100 Paint Branch Parkway, Office of Compliance (HFS-608), Division of Enforcement, College Park, Maryland 20740-3835.

RE:     Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresses www.perfectlyhealthy.com, www.cfnmedicine.com, www.cancercenterforhealing.com, and www.shopcfnmedicine.com on April 24, 2020 and April 30, 2020, respectively.  We have also reviewed your social media sites at www.youtube.com/channel/UCwWXwsxn8KGL0UPmJc13IuQ, www.facebook.com/ConnealyMD, and www.facebook.com/CenterForNewMedicine, where you direct consumers to your websites www.perfectlyhealthy.com and www.cfnmedicine.com to purchase your products.  The FDA has observed that your websites offer the products Camu Camu’s Vitamin C, Vitality C, Immunity Kit, Vitamin D3-K2, Liquid Silver, and Power Immune for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently an outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.2In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.3Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your websites that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
•    “We offer immunity building protocols and treatments that may help during the spread of the COVID-19 virus. These include:o    Vitamin D3-K2The immune system uses vitamin D to make antimicrobial weapons that puncture holes in …viruses.o    Liquid SilverColloidal Silver has been a very effective way to kill …virus[es] … for many years.o    Power ImmuneWe have used this blend for many years at the Center for New Medicine.

This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not misleadingly representing your products as safe and effective for a COVID-19 related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours, please send an emailtoCOVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.govdescribing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found athttp://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products. Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
If you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States.

RE:                 Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.benjaminmcevoy.com onMay 6, 2020 and May 12, 2020, respectively. While reviewing your website, FDA observed that you participate in the Amazon Associates program.  As an Amazon associate, you earn commissions by promoting the sale of products including dietary supplements (hereinafter referred to as “Amazon associate products”)[1]with claims on your website representing or implying that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[2]in people.  Based on our review, these claims cause the Amazon associate products purchased through links on your website to be unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352.  Causing the introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).  In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being misbranded.
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[3]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[4]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described above, you promote and participate in the sale of products for use in mitigating, preventing, treating, diagnosing, or curing COVID-19 in people, as evidenced by the claims from your website quoted below. We request that you immediately cease promoting and participating in the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your website https://benjaminmcevoy.com/top-7-supplements-boosting-immune-system/that establish the intended use of your Amazon associate products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
“Top 7 Supplements for Boosting your Immune System . . . With global panic around coronavirus at an all time high, now is the time to improve your health. You can do that by . . . adding in smart supplementation. . . . These are supplements I have taken and benefited from for years. They have been studied endlessly, and could be promising additions to your supplement stack if you’re worried about coronavirus”
“NAC (N-acetylcysteine) [Amazon associate link] . . . It’s early days still in regards to NAC and coronavirus, but seeing as the supplement has a wide range of immune-boosting properties, this makes it a sensible investment and my top recommendation. You can learn more and buy NAC here [Amazon associate link].”
""Zinc [Amazon associate link] . . . Supplementing with zinc picolinate is extremely wise, especially in these coronavirus times, as it is a mineral with power immune-boosting effects. Zinc has been . . . found to reduce the severity and duration of colds, flus, infections, wounds, and many other diseases. . . . You can learn more and buy zinc here [Amazon associate link].”
“Vitamin C [Amazon associate link] . . . I personally haven’t taken a vitamin C supplement for any extended period of time, only choosing to utilize one when I actually get sick . . . But you may wish to add a vitamin C supplement to your arsenal in this [sic] COVID-19 times, especially if you don’t get much in your diet. . . . You can learn more and buy vitamin C here [Amazon associate link].”
“Vitamin D [Amazon associate link] . . . even if coronavirus wasn’t spreading throughout the world right now, you would benefit greatly from vitamin D supplementation. It would . . . make your innate and adaptive immune responses more robust. If you’re deficient in vitamin D, you’re way more susceptible to disease and infection and less equipped to fight them off valiantly. Vitamin D has also been shown to reduce odds of developing a respiratory infection by roughly 42%. Take Vitamin D every day. . . . You can learn more and buy vitamin D here [Amazon associate link].”
“Magnesium [Amazon associate link] . . . Magnesium citrate is another mineral that many people are deficient in, and deficiency is linked with reduce [sic] immune response and increased susceptibility to viral infections. . . . You can learn more and buy magnesium here [Amazon associate link].”
“Ashwaghanda [Amazon associate link] . . . Ashwaghanda is an adaptogen . . . which has many studied but yet to be understood positive effects on the immune system. Adaptogens reduce cortisol levels and improve immune response . . . You can learn more and buy ashwaghanda here [Amazon associate link].”
“Echinacea [Amazon associate link] has some promising studies that demonstrate the supplement to have antiviral properties against certain coronaviruses. . . . You can learn more and buy echinacea here [Amazon associate link].”
“Those are my personal supplement recommendations based on years of supplementation for improved immune response.”

March 20, 2020
Dear Mr. & Mrs. Eichhorn:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 4747-20 Nesconset Hwy, Port Jefferson Station, NY 11766 on August 9th, 14th, 16th, and 21st, 2019. In addition, we reviewed product labels for your Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Unflavored Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Chocolate Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Strawberry Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Vanilla Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin, Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps, Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules, and Colostrum Capsules. Based on the inspectional findings, a review of your product labels, and a review of your website at the internet address www.essentialsfactor.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations.
You can find the Act and the FDA regulations through links in FDA’s website at www.fda.gov (http://www.fda.gov).
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
You explained to our investigator that(b)(4)of the Unflavored and Flavored Multi-Mineral and Vitamin Blend dietary supplements that you sell are sold in “kits.” These kits include one bottle of Multi-Mineral and Vitamin Blend powder (Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Unflavored Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Chocolate Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Strawberry Powdered Mix, or Cell Synergy Vanilla Powdered Mix) and one bottle of Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps. Your product labels for these items in the kit provide your website address, www.essentialsfactor.com, where consumers can view more information about “the program” and how they should consume the products in the kit.
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.essentialsfactor.com in February 2020. The claims on your website establish that your kit is a drug under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because it is intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering this product for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your kit is intended for use as a drug include:
• Under the header, “Primary Discussion” on the website, the information provided lists recommended servings sizes for Cancerous Conditions and Non-Cancerous Conditions. Per the website, 4 servings of the multi-mineral & vitamin powdered mix taken in conjunction with 4 servings of the cod liver oil gel cap soft gels (“the program” or “the kit”) are suggested for cancerous conditions.
In addition to the above-recommended 4 daily servings to treat cancerous conditions, your website also recommends daily servings of the kit to treat a variety of color-coded non-cancerous conditions, including, but not limited to, the following:
• Autism (denoted in purple font, which indicates a daily dosage amount of 2-3 servings per day),• Renal Failure (denoted in brown font, which indicates a daily dosage amount of 3-4 servings per day),• Down’s syndrome (denoted in purple font, which indicates a daily dosage amount of 2-3 servings per day),• Hypertension (denoted in green font, which indicates a daily dosage amount of 3 servings per day), and• Metal Poisoning (denoted in red font, which indicates a daily dosage amount of 4 servings per day).
Your website claims also provide evidence that your Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules product, whose product label also bears your website, is intended for use as a drug. Under the header, “Olive Leaf Extract” with the sub-header “with Whole Colostrum,” the information provided states the following claims:
• “…Studies have shown each to be extremely valuable in helping combat a wide array of bacterial and viral infections…”• “Likewise, both olive leaf extract and whole Colostrum have been used successfully by many naturally-oriented physicians and their patients to deal with auto-immune conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis…”• “…has been shown to disrupt and even eliminate a wide variety of bacterial and viral infections…”• “Olive leaf extract also has been proven beneficial in normalizing blood pressure and LDL cholesterol levels, combating inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, fighting allergies, controlling complications of diabetes…”• “Colostrum work as an efficient team to build an immune system which can fend off any attack, …ranging from speeding the healing of injuries…”• “…As we are faced with new strains of flu every year, alarming reports of drug-resistant bacteria among us, and an increasing number of allergens in our environment…”• “Olive Leaf Extract is a natural antibiotic, anti-bacterial, anti-viral & anti-fungal compound”• “Unlike synthetic antibiotics, olive leaf destroys only the bad bacterial and protects the good. Medical research suggests that when olive leaf extract is taken orally, it searches out and “inactivates” the bacteria. It does this by dissolving outer lining of the infectious germs and then it penetrates the infected cells, thus inhibiting the replication of the bacteria.”• “Many medical researchers are becoming increasingly concerned about the emergence of super germs that have developed a resistance to antibiotic drugs. (1) Olive leaf extract is increasingly used in Europe as a replacement for synthetic antibiotics. In the USA, olive leaf extract is being used by a growing number of medical practitioners to combat bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts and protozoa.”• “In the USA, olive leaf extract is being used by a growing number of medical practitioners to combat bacteria, viruses, fungi, yeasts, and protozoa. Examples include: strep throat, colds, influenza, pneumonia, ear infections, urinary infections, yeast infections, dental infections, staph infections, severe diarrhea, Tinea, Conjunctivitis, cold sores, Shingles, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, Epstein-Barr, Candida, Chlamydia, gonorrhea, meningitis, encephalitis, tuberculosis, food poisoning, E-coli, Salmonella, Herpes, Hepatitis A & B, HIV/AIDS (2), blood poisoning and malaria.”• “Olive Leaf Extract’s powerful antioxidant may be beneficial against Diabetic complications[:]People with diabetes are likely to develop complications such as retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy as a result of oxidative stress and overwhelming free radicals.”• “Studies show that oleuropein may inhibit hyperglycemia and oxidative stress caused by diabetes and suggests that oleuropin may be helpful in the prevention of diabetic complications associated with oxidative stress.”• “Some people may experience what is known as Herxheimers Reaction (temporary symptoms include fatigue, diarrhea, muscle and joint pains, headaches, rashes, flu-like symptoms). This is a sign that the olive leaf extract killing a large number of harmful germs quickly…”
The above-listed products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, this product is a “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C.§ 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in section 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 355(a)]; see also section 301(d) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(d)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Unflavored Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Chocolate Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Strawberry Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Vanilla Powdered Mix, and Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps (components of “the kit” or “the program”) and your Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, these products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
Even if the above-mentioned products did not have therapeutic claims which make them unapproved new drugs and/or misbranded drugs, they would be adulterated dietary supplements within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] for the reasons described below. The August 9th, 14th, 16th, & 21st, inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 111 (21 CFR 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements
We have received your response, dated September 4, 2019, concerning the observations noted on the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to your firm on August 21st, 2019. We address this response below, in relation to each of the noted violations.
1. Your quality control personnel approved and released for distribution a batch of dietary supplement that did not meet established product specifications under 21 CFR 111.70(e), in violation of 21 CFR 111.123(b)(2). Specifically, the finished product Certificate of Analysis, dated 9/24/2018 for Strawberry Flavored Powder Mix, Multi-Mineral & Vitamin Supplement, Lot#(b)(4)documents the finished product heavy metal specification(b)(4). The product was tested(b)(4)and(b)(4). This product was released for distribution(b)(4). In addition, the finished product Certificate of Analysis, dated 5/29/2019 for Unflavored Powder Mix, Multi-Mineral & Vitamin Supplement, Lot#(b)(4)documents the finished product heavy metal specification(b)(4). The product was tested(b)(4)and(b)(4). This product was released for distribution on(b)(4)and(b)(4). These products were released in violation of 21 CFR 111.77(a) as your quality control personnel failed to reject the dietary supplement and permitted their release for distribution.
We have reviewed your written response dated September 4, 2019. You state that you that you will create and implement written quality control procedures for conducting material reviews, create a deviation evaluation procedure, and that you are conducting testing to investigate whether your raw materials and your Strawberry Powders and Unflavored Powders contain organic or inorganic arsenic and the amount of each. We are unable to assess the adequacy of your response because you have not provided documentation to support the aforementioned corrective actions.
2. You failed to prepare a batch production record every time you manufacture a batch of a dietary supplement, as required by 21CFR 111.255(a), and in accordance with 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, you receive packaged Flavored and Unflavored Powdered Mix, Multi-mineral & Vitamin Supplement & Cod liver soft-gels for your labeling operations at your facility; however, you do not prepare batch production records to document your labeling operation.
We have reviewed your written response dated September 4, 2019, in which you stated that your firm will create and implement Batch Production procedures for creating, printing, distribution and holding of the labels for each of the dietary supplements. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide evidence that you have created and implemented written batch production records to document the labeling operations for your dietary supplement products.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement to ensure that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the MMR, as required by 21CFR 111.205(b)(1). Specifically, you receive packaged Flavored and Unflavored Powdered Mix, Multi-mineral & Vitamin Supplement & Cod liver soft-gels for labeling operations at your facility; however, you do not prepare master manufacturing records to document your labeling operation.We have reviewed your written response dated September 4, 2019, in which you stated that your firm will establish procedures for holding and in-house labeling operations of bottles of dietary supplements. We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide evidence that you have established such procedures. We also note that your response didn’t address your failure to have MMRs for how you label your products.
We further note that, as a dietary supplement distributor that contracts with a manufacturer to manufacture a dietary supplement that you distribute under your firm’s name, you have an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that your firm can make decisions related to whether your packaged and labeled dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution [see 72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34790 (Jun. 25, 2007)]. Your firm introduces or delivers, or causes the introduction or delivery of, dietary supplements into interstate commerce in their final form for distribution to consumers. As such, your firm has an overarching and ultimate responsibility to ensure that all phases of the production of those products are in compliance with dietary supplement CGMP requirements.
Although a firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations, it cannot, by the same token, contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplements it places into commerce (or causes to be placed into commerce) are not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements (see United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 284 (1943) (explaining that an offense can be committed under the Act by anyone who has “a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws”); United States v. Park, 421 U.S. 658, 672 (1975) (holding that criminal liability under the Act does not turn on awareness of wrongdoing, and that “agents vested with the responsibility, and power commensurate with that responsibility, to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act” can be held accountable for violations of the Act)). The Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section 402(g) for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements (see 21 U.S.C. §§ 342(g) and 331(a)). Thus, a firm that enters a contract with other firms to conduct certain dietary supplement manufacturing, packaging, and/or labeling operations for it is responsible for ensuring that the product is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements, regardless of who actually performs the dietary supplement CGMP operations.
You receive bulk packaged dietary supplements from a contract manufacturer that manufactures the dietary supplement on your behalf, which you label, hold, and distribute into interstate commerce. As such, quality control personnel must ensure that the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.105). As you perform such operations, you must make and keep written documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control personnel perform the review, approval, or rejection requirements, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2).Misbranded Dietary Supplements
In addition, your dietary supplement products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR Part 101, for the reasons discussed as follows:
1. Your Essentials Factor brand products including Cell Synergy Unflavored Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Chocolate Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Strawberry Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Vanilla Powdered Mix, Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin, Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps, PRP Isolate Spray, Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules, and Colostrum Capsules are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] because the labels fail to include a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplements. “Domestic address or domestic phone number” means a complete address or phone number. The labels for these products do not include a complete address or phone number.
2. Your Essentials Factor brand products – Cell Synergy Powdered Mix (Unflavored, Chocolate, Strawberry, and Vanilla flavors), Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin, Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps, PRP Isolate Spray, Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules, and Colostrum Capsules – are misbranded within the meaning of Section 403(e)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343 (e)(1)] in that the label fails to list the name and place of business of the manufacturer, packer, or distributor in accordance with 21 CFR 101.5.
3. Your Essentials Factor brand Olive Leaf Extract with Whole Colostrum Capsules product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, the product label does not provide the source of colostrum.
4. Your Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy and Powdered Mix (Strawberry and Vanilla flavors), Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin, Essentials Factor brand Colostrum Capsules, and Essentials Factor brand and Cellect brand Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example,
• Your Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Powdered Mix (Strawberry and Vanilla flavors) and Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin product labels fail to express the amount of total carbohydrate in the increment specified in 101.9(c)(6). [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)].•Your Essentials Factor brand Colostrum Capsules product label fails to express the amount of calories, cholesterol, sodium, potassium, and protein in the increment specified in 101.9(c). [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)].• Your Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Powdered Mix (Strawberry and Vanilla flavors) and Essentials Factor brand Cell Synergy Capsules with Gelatin product labels bear an incorrect %DV for magnesium based on the quantitative amount declared per serving in accordance with 21 CFR 111.36(b)(2)(iii).• Your Essentials Factor brand and Cellect brand Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps product labels present the amount per softgel to the left of the amount per serving (3 softgels). While the quantitative amount by weight and the percent Daily Value of each dietary ingredient may be presented on a ""per unit"" basis in addition to the ""per serving"" basis, the ""per unit"" information must be presented in an additional column to the right of the ""per serving"" information in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e)(9)(i).• Your Essentials Factor brand and Cellect brand Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps product labels declare cholesterol with an amount of 0 and your Essentials Factor brand Colostrum Capsules product label declares total fat, calories from fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, sugar, vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron with an amount of 0 or an amount that can be declared as zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in an amount that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).• Your Essentials Factor brand and Cellect brand Cod Liver Oil Gel Caps product labels declare EPA and DHA with an amount indicated as “amount varies” rather than the quantitative amount by weight per serving as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3)(ii).• Your Essentials Factor Colostrum Capsules product label fails to declare the quantitative amount of calcium per serving as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(A).• Your Essentials Factor Colostrum Capsules product label fails to list the dietary ingredients in the correct order as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.36(b)(3)(i).• Your Essentials Factor Colostrum Capsules product label fails to express the % Daily Values to the nearest whole percent as required by 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C).• Your Cellect brand Powdered Mix (Unflavored and Strawberry flavors) labels bear an incorrect %DV for total carbohydrate based on the quantitative amount declared per serving.
5. Your Essentials Factor brand PRP Isolate Spray product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the label fails to declare the correct servings per container in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii). The net contents are stated as 150 mL and the serving size is 2 mL; therefore the number of servings per container should be 75.
6. Your Essentials Factor brand PRP Isolate Spray product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because the label does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
We have reviewed your written response dated September 4, 2019; however, your response does not specifically address these violations.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products.

Section 743 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31, authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees, 21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.

CC:                  regulatory-inquiries@amazon.com – Amazon Associates Program
RE:                 Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.washingtonslastfrontier.com on May 5, 2020. While reviewing your website, FDA observed that you participate in the Amazon Associates program.  As an Amazon associate, you earn commissions by promoting the sale of products including essential oils and dietary supplements (hereinafter referred to as “Amazon associate products”)[1]with claims on your website representing or implying that the products can mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[2]in people.  Based on our review, these claims cause the Amazon associate products purchased through links on your website to be unapproved new drugs under section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352.  Causing the introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).  In addition, it is a prohibited act under section 301(k) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(k), to do any act with respect to a drug, if such act is done while the drug is held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce and results in the drug being misbranded.
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[3]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[4]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described above, you promote and participate in the sale of products for use in mitigating, preventing, treating, diagnosing, or curing COVID-19 in people, as evidenced by the claims from your website quoted below. We request that you immediately cease promoting and participating in the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your website that establish the intended use of your Amazon associate products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
“Coronavirus: Preparing For A Global Pandemic (Things To Consider). . . How to prepare for a possible pandemic . . . MEDICINES . . . doTerra’s Oregano essential oil [Amazon associate link] (which is a natural, very potent, antibiotic) and OnGuard protective blend [Amazon associate link], both of which would be crucial for a virus pandemic . . . The most preventative flu remedy is high-dose . . . Vitamin D3 + K2 [Amazon associate link] so maybe go ahead and start taking those daily now to boost the immune system (we are!). Another pro tip: antibiotics you can purchase online! My recommendations: Dr. Christopher’s Infection blend [Amazon associate link] . . .” [from your website https://washingtonslastfrontier.com/blog/coronavirus-preparedness]
“Licorice Root For Coronavirus? . . . ‘Licorice root as a potential treatment for Coronavirus (COVID-19).’” [from your website https://washingtonslastfrontier.com/blog/licorice-root-coronavirus]
The statements “In one study, glycyrrhizin – a compound found in licorice root – was found to be the most active in inhibiting replication of the SARS virus (which is a coronavirus). ‘One of the significant antiviral candidates under study during the period immediately after SARS was the Licorice Root…’” and the image of a licorice root product with the statement “BUY ON AMAZON [Amazon associate link]. [from your website https://washingtonslastfrontier.com/blog/licorice-root-coronavirus]
The statement “‘Licorice root had already been known for its antiviral properties but researchers noticed that during the SARS outbreak that certain groups of people drinking concoctions of traditional Chinese medicine that contained it during the SARS outbreak did not get infected with the virus despite having been exposed to it by having relatives in the same household who were infected.’” and the image of a licorice root product with the statement “BUY ON AMAZON [Amazon associate link]” [from your website https://washingtonslastfrontier.com/blog/licorice-root-coronavirus]
You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter.  This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that your activities as an Amazon associate do not violate the FD&C Act. We advise you to review your websites and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure thatyou arenotmisleadingly representing your Amazon associate products as safe and effective for a COVID-19-related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours, please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.govdescribing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations.  Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list onFDA’swebsite of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found athttp://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products.Once you have taken corrective actionsto cease promoting the sale of unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19,and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your Amazon associate products and activities are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made.  For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above.  Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence.  You must immediately cease making all such claims.  Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns.

This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reviewed your website at the Internet address www.drjockers.com on March 19, 2020 and April 14, 2020, respectively. We have also reviewed your social media sites at www.facebook.com/DrDavidJockers and www.instagram.com/drjockers/, where you direct consumers to your website, www.drjockers.com, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers the products Super C, Vitamin D/K2, Zinc Charge, and ImmunoStrong Berry Liquid (labeled to contain elderberry and astragalus) for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-191in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352.

Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
If you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States.
Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CFSAN@fda.hhs.gov.
In addition, it is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 41 et seq., to advertise that a product can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products identified above. Thus, any coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims. Violations of the FTC Act may result in legal action seeking a Federal District Court injunction and an order may require that you pay back money to consumers. Within 48 hours, please send an email to Richard Cleland, Assistant Director of the FTC’s Division of Advertising Practices, via electronic mail at rcleland@ftc.gov describing the specific actions you have taken to address the FTC’s concerns.

WL 599389
Dear Mr. Kosyak:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 6162 Kalanianaole Hwy, Honolulu, HI 96821-2371 from October 30, 2019 through November 7, 2019. Based on the inspectional findings, a subsequent review of your product labels collected during the inspection and your website, www.hawaiipharm.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s website atwww.fda.gov.
Dietary Supplement Adulteration (CGMP)
The inspection revealed the following significant violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements. We have received your written response dated November 20, 2019, concerning our investigator’s observations noted on the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on November 7, 2019; we address your response for the specific violations discussed below.
1. You failed to establish identity specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). Specifically, you have not established identity specifications for any incoming herbal ingredients that you receive and subsequently use to manufacture your dietary supplement products.
Once you have established component specifications and before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2).
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response, you stated(b)(4). You stated to our investigator(b)(4), and your response states(b)(4). Your response also states(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any copies of the component specifications that you have established thus far.
2. You failed to establish product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have not established finished product specifications for any of dietary supplements that you manufacture and distribute.
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response you stated(b)(4). Your response states(b)(4). The response also states(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide copies of any of your finished product specifications completed thus far.
3. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, during the inspection you stated to our investigator(b)(4).
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response you stated(b)(4). You also state(b)(4). You also stated(b)(4)the MMRs(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide copies of MMRs.
4. You failed to prepare a batch production record (BPR) every time you manufacture a batch of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). Specifically, during the inspection, you stated to our investigator(b)(4).
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response, you stated(b)(4). You state(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any copies of batch production records.
5. You failed to make and keep written procedures to fulfill the requirements that apply to the review and investigation of a product complaint, as required by 21 CFR 111.570(b)(1). Specifically, your firm does not have written procedures for product complaints.
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response, you stated(b)(4). You also stated(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide your written complaints procedure.
6. You failed to collect and hold reserve samples of each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements that you distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(a). Specifically, your firm does not have a written procedure for maintaining reserve samples, and you do not maintain reserve samples of any of the dietary supplement products your firm has manufactured.
We have reviewed your November 20, 2019 response. In your response, you stated(b)(4). You stated(b)(4). We are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide the written procedure. You referenced a document called(b)(4), Reserve Samples Record, but your response did not include this attachment. Furthermore, reserve samples are required to be retained for 1 year past the shelf life date (if shelf life dating is used) or for 2 years from the date of distribution of the last batch of dietary supplements associated with the reserve sample, for use in appropriate investigations. 21 CFR 111.83(b)(3).
Dietary Supplement Adulteration (non-CGMP)
The dietary supplement products discussed below are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(f) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)] in that they are or contain a dietary ingredient that presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
1. The Non-Alcohol Bala (Sida Cordifolia), 4 fl. oz., and Bala (Sida Cordifolia), 4 fl. oz., products listed on your website, www.hawaiipharm.com, are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(f)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(f)(1)(A)] in that each product label declaresSidacordifolia, a source of ephedrine alkaloids, which presents an unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended or suggested in the labeling, or if no conditions of use are recommended or suggested in the labeling, under ordinary conditions of use. [21 CFR 119.1; see Final Rule Declaring Dietary Supplements Containing Ephedrine Alkaloids Adulterated Because They Present an Unreasonable Risk, 69 FR 6788, 6793 (Feb. 11, 2004).]
Dietary Supplement Misbranding
The dietary supplement products discussed below are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 [21 U.S.C. § 343] of the Act and/or fail to comply with the regulations implementing the food labeling requirements of the Act, which are found in 21 CFR Part 101.
1. Your Hawaii Pharm brand Cat’s Claw, Fo-Ti Root, and Frankincense products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(y) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(y)] in that the label fails to bear a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person (as described in section 761) may receive a report of a serious adverse event with such dietary supplement.
2. Your Hawaii Pharm brand Cat’s Claw, Fo-Ti Root, and Frankincense products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act in that the product label fails to list other ingredients immediately following the supplement facts label required by 21 CFR 101.4(g).
3. Your Hawaii Pharm brand Cat’s Claw, Fo-Ti Root, and Frankincense products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] because the Supplement Facts label is not in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36. For example, the products bear the following statement: “Percent Daily Values based on a 2,000 calorie diet.” This statement is only permitted when the percent of Daily Value is declared for total fat, saturated fat, total carbohydrate, dietary fiber, or protein as required by 21 CFR 101.9(c) and 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(D).
4. Your Hawaii Pharm brand Cat’s Claw is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify within the Supplement Facts label the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the “proprietary blend” is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
In addition, we offer the following comments:
• We note that the Wild Ginger (Asarum Splendens), 4 fl. oz., and Non-Alcohol Wild Ginger (Asarum Splendens), 4 fl. oz., products listed on your website, www.hawaiipharm.com, declare the ingredientAsarum Splendens.Asarum Splendensis a potential source of aristolochic acid, which is a potent carcinogen and nephrotoxin. Consumption of products containing aristolochic acid has been associated with permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. You should ensure that your product does not contain aristolochic acid.
• In your November 20, 2019 response,(b)(4)electronic records for several of your corrective actions. FDA has provided Guidance for Industry regarding the scope and application of the requirements for Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures in 21 CFR Part 11 at https://www.fda.gov/media/75414/download.

AMENDED WARNING LETTER
Ref: # DEN-20-02-WL
Dear Mr. Roderick:
From April 15-24, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility located at 470 N. 56th Street, Chandler, Arizona. Based on the inspectional findings, a review of the product labels collected during the inspection, and a review of your website at www.enzymeprocess.co, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at www.enzymeprocess.co in September 2019 and has determined that you take orders there for the following products: Liverchol, Celery Seed, ColoNorm G, Agaricus Blazei Mycelia, Zymepro, B-Plus w/Glandulars, Thyroid Cytotrophin, and Alkaplex Green products. The claims on your website establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.
Examples of some of the claims observed on your website that provide evidence that these products are intended for use as drugs include the following:
LiverChol, product page
“The herbs in Liverchol . . . lower LDL cholesterol . . . [and] help the liver to defend itself against certain viral infections. . . . The herbs in Liverchol along with a balanced diet may help prevent Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.”
ColoNorm G, product page
“The herbs, bentonite and magnesium ascorbate may reduce the transit time through the intestinal tract. Reducing the transit time through the intestinal tract may lessen the risk for inflammatory diseases of the colon.”
“May Reduce Inflammation.”
ZymePro, all sizes, including Veggie, product pages
“During inflammation flare ups, take 3 tablets twice daily.”
B-Plus w/Glandulars, product page
“Fight Chronic Fatigue with our Superior B-Complex Formulation”
Agaricus Blazei Mycelia, from blog of December 10, 2018, entitled: “Agaricus Blazei Mycelia”
“The Japanese use an Agaricus water/ethanol extract to treat arteriosclerosis, hepatitis, high cholesterol, diabetes, dermatitis, and cancer. Japanese research shows that compounds called polysaccharides and anti-angiogenic compounds present in Agaricus may be responsible for its antitumor properties. . . . Additional beneficial effects of Agaricus water/ethanol extracts found in studies include an increase in insulin sensitivity in diabetics. . . . [This increase in insulin sensitivity] may also improve serum glucose and cholesterol levels.”
Thyroid Cytotrophin, from blog of March 21, 2019, entitled: “What Is a Protomorphogen?”
“Data taken from a database of over a thousand subjects has shown the beneficial effect of liver, thyroid and lung glandular concentrates on their respective target tissues by moving their serum chemistries generally up toward the ideal range and those which were above the medical range, move down, toward the ideal range, when an individual ingests the appropriate thyroid treatment or protomorphogen.”
Celery Seed, from blog of December 12, 2018, entitled: “Celery Seed – Improve digestion and liver functions and stimulates the kidneys to promote urine flow.”
“The modern use of celery focuses on its anti-inflammatory and anti-arthritic properties for joint pain and gout.”
“Celery seed along with an anti-gout diet may help to reduce gout flares.”
“Celery seed has anti-microbial activity specifically against Helicobacterpylori (H. Pylori). . . For people with a history of Helicobacterpyloriinduced ulcers, regular use of celery seed may be helpful.”
Alkaplex Green, from blog of December 10, 2018, entitled: “ALKAPLEX GREEN “Salad in a capsule.”
“Barley Greens [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] contain antioxidants that stop free radicals and reduce inflammation. Inflammation is the first step in many diseases including arthritis and cancer. Reducing inflammation helps to prevent many diseases.”
“Wheat Grass [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] . . . contains bioflavonoids such as apigenin. . . . The bioflavonoid apigenin is a potent anti-inflammatory.”
“Alfalfa [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green]. . . is effective against diabetes, thyroid gland malfunction, arthritis, high cholesterol, and peptic ulcers.”
“Chlorophyll [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] is able to form tight molecular complexes with certain chemicals known or suspected to cause cancer. The protective mechanism of chlorophyll is quite simply – it just binds with and sequesters carcinogens within the gastrointestinal tract until they pass out of the body.”
“Spirulina [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] benefits the cardiovascular system by lowering bad cholesterol . . . and has anti-inflammatory activity.”
Parsley Leaf [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] . . . may prevent diabetes, has mild pain relieving properties, prevents ulcers, lowers blood pressure and is anti-bacterial and anti-fungal. Parsley may prevent urinary tract infections.”
“Celery [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] contains . . .anti-inflammatory properties. Celery may help lower blood pressure and cholesterol. . . . Celery reduces factors that cause cancer.”
“Watercress [an ingredient in Alkaplex Green] reduces DNA damage which is linked to a reduced risk of cancer. The reduced risk of cancer is by increasing carotenoid concentrations (antioxidants) in the body.”
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 321(p)(1)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 USC §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Liverchol, Celery Seed, Agaricus Blazei Mycelia, B-Plus w/Glandulars, Thyroid Cytotrophin, and Alkaplex Green products are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your Liverchol, Celery Seed, Agaricus Blazei Mycelia, B-Plus w/Glandulars, Thyroid Cytotrophin, and Alkaplex Green products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
Dietary Supplement CGMP Violations
The dietary supplement products that you manufacture, package, label, and/or hold are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 342(g)(1)] because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements in 21 CFR Part 111. Additionally, even if the product labeling for your Alkaplex Green did not have therapeutic claims which make this product an unapproved new drug and misbranded drug, this product would still be an adulterated dietary supplement within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act because the product has been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements. Following the April 2019 inspection of your facility, FDA issued a Form FDA 483 Inspectional Observations addressing many of the issues discussed below. We have received two written responses from you dated May 14 and August 9, 2019, which will be addressed as appropriate below.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. Your quality control personnel failed to comply with 21 CFR 111.123(b)(1) because they approved and released for distribution a batch of dietary supplement for which a component in the batch did not meet its identity specification. Specifically, your quality control personnel approved and released for distribution Advance CardioZyme Capsules Lot #5237 and Pro-T-Complex Capsules Lot #4897 that were manufactured with the components Phosphatidyl Choline (Lot#(b)(4)) and Zinc(b)(4)(Lot#(b)(4)), respectively; neither component met its established identity specification.
We have reviewed your written response, dated May 14 and August 9, 2019, which purport to address this deficiency either by establishing new identity specifications or retesting the components at issue to confirm compliance. Such activities do not demonstrate that you have taken corrective action to ensure that you will comply with applicable quality control requirements going forward.
2. You failed to ensure that the test and examinations that you used to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1). Specifically, you used(b)(4)to verify the identity of(b)(4)Thyroid Substance Lot#(b)(4), which is an ingredient in your product Thyroid HP; however,(b)(4)lacks the specificity to identify the ingredients in multi-ingredient dietary supplement products or distinguish between products with similar chemical structures, such as(b)(4)substance(b)(4), thymus substance(b)(4), and hypothalamus substance(b)(4).
3. You failed to establish and follow laboratory control processes that are reviewed and approved by quality control personnel, for use of criteria for selecting standard reference materials used in performing tests and examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.315(d). For example, it was observed that you tested Manganese(b)(4)Chelate Lot#(b)(4)(a dietary ingredient in your Pro-T-Complex product) by(b)(4)using Zinc(b)(4)Chelate Lot#(b)(4)as the standard spectrum. Zinc(b)(4)Chelate is not an appropriate standard spectrum for Manganese(b)(4)Chelate.
We have reviewed your written response, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you state that you tested Manganese(b)(4)Chelate Lot#(b)(4). Lot#(b)(4)is not the lot observed at the time of the inspection (Lot#(b)(4)). Also note that comparison of the sample of Manganese(b)(4)Chelate with(b)(4)of material does not constitute comparison with standard reference materials. You must ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods (see 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1)).
4. You failed to establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, you have not established specifications for purity, strength, and composition of your Irish Moss(b)(4)used in the manufacture of your Pro-T-Complex dietary supplement capsules, or your(b)(4)used in the manufacture of your Advance CardioZyme.
We have reviewed your written response regarding this issue, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you provided the specifications for several components used in the manufacture of your products. However, none of the component specifications include all of the specifications required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2). For example, the provided specifications for the Irish Moss(b)(4)does not include specifications for purity, strength, or composition.
5. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength and composition of the finished batch of dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you failed to establish:
Identity and purity specifications for your CardioZyme and Pro-T-Complex dietary supplements.
Strength specifications (i.e., assay) for the Irish Moss and Glandular Blend ingredients in your Pro-T-Complex and the EDTA, Guggul, Phosphalidyl Choline, Nattokinase, and Policosanol ingredients in your CardioZyme.
Composition specifications for your Advanced CardioZyme and Pro-T-Complex products. During the inspection you provided purported specifications for your Pro-T-Complex product, but the documentation you provided fails to account for the Irish Moss and Glandular Blend ingredients in the product. You were unable to provide any composition specification for the Advanced CardioZyme.
We have reviewed your written response regarding this issue, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you provided Finished Product Specification Sheets for Advance CardioZyme Capsules (Version 01) and PRO-T-Complex Capsules (Version 01). However, we identified the following problems with your specification sheets:
The finished product specifications for Advance CardioZyme Capsules and PRO-T-Complex Capsules do not include established identity specifications.
Your assay specification for Advance CardioZyme states all ingredients must be(b)(4)to(b)(4)% of label claim; however, it does not include the composition and strength of each dietary ingredient that will be claimed on the product label. Additionally, your finished product label for CardioZyme states the product contains 50% Octacosanol; therefore, you need to establish a purity specification to verify that NLT 50% Octacosanol is present in the product.
Your assay specification for PRO-T Complex states it contains a proprietary blend of(b)(4); however, it does not include the composition and strength of the ingredients that comprise the proprietary blend. Additionally, verification of your proprietary blend is by(b)(4). Verification that a specification has been met is determined by testing and not by(b)(4).
6. You failed to establish master manufacturing records (MMR) for the Advance CardioZyme Caps and Pro-T-Complex Capsules that include all elements required by 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, your MMRs for these products fail to include:
A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made [21 CFR 111.210(f)]. For example, these MMRs lacked a statement of theoretical yield at the encapsulation and bottling stages of the manufacturing process.
A description of packaging and a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label [21 CFR 111.210(g)]. For example, your MMR’s for Advance CardioZyme Caps and Pro-T-Complex Capsules provide an inconsistent description of your packaging materials. Both MMRs state that a “(b)(4)”; however,(b)(4)is not listed elsewhere in your MMR as a packaging material (i.e., in your Packaging Traveler Record).
Written instructions for procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations [21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)].
We have reviewed your written response, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you provided a revised MMR template for(b)(4)Capsules. The revised template includes a theoretical yield as required by 21 CFR 111.210(f). However, the revised template does not include a description of packaging and a representative label or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g). It also does not include written instructions for procedures for sampling (21 CFR 111.210(h)(2)). It cross refences to an SOP, but you did not provide a copy of the SOP for review which may have allowed us to determine whether this requirement has been met.
7. Your batch production records (BPR) fail to meet the requirements of 21 CFR 111.255. Specifically, your BPR for Alkaplex Green, Lot #4263, failed to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) (see also 21 CFR 111.260). Specifically, during a previous FDA inspection that ended November 28, 2016, FDA observed certificates of analysis for this lot that demonstrated that your Alkaplex Green did not meet specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e) (see 21 CFR 111.260(i)). During the April 2019 inspection, however, the investigator found that you no longer have these original certificates of analysis. Therefore, the BPR for Lot #4263 of Alkaplex Green fails to include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch.
We have reviewed your written response, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you provided copies of three Certificates of Analysis for Alkaplex Green, lot #4263. However, you did not provide the entire batch production record for review. As such, we are unable to evaluate the sufficiency of your corrective action.
8. You failed to use equipment or utensils of appropriate design, construction and workmanship to enable them to be adequately cleaned and properly maintained, as required by 21 CFR 111.27(a). Specifically, your(b)(4)equipment used for tableting your dietary supplement products was observed to contain(b)(4)on various product contact surfaces, which does not allow the equipment to be adequately cleaned and properly maintained. This is a repeat observation from the 2016 inspection.
We have reviewed your written response, dated May 14, 2019. In your response, you provided photos purporting to demonstrate the removal of the(b)(4). However, there is a(b)(4)on the tablet(b)(4)that is an obstruction to cleaning non-product contact surfaces. It appears a(b)(4)attached to a(b)(4)has(b)(4)to it in Room(b)(4)and what appears to be product residue on the tablet(b)(4).
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
The dietary supplement products discussed below are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 [21 U.S.C. § 343] of the Act and/or fail to comply with the regulations implementing the food labeling requirements of the Act, which are found in 21 CFR Part 101. Even if your Enzyme Process brand ZymePro Thyroid Cytotrophin, and B Plus with Glandulars products were not unapproved new drugs/misbranded drugs, they would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act and/or in violation of the following provisions of 21 CFR Part 101.
1. Your Enzyme Process brand Multi Life product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the labeling is misleading because it fails to state a material fact [see section 201(n) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 321(n))]. Specifically, the label for this product fails to bear the following warning statement about the risk of fatal poisoning in children under 6: “WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately.” Dietary supplements in solid oral dosage form that contain iron or iron salts are required to bear this warning statement [see 21 CFR 101.17(e)]. The label on your Multi Life product, which is in capsule form, declares iron as an ingredient. However, the label does not include the warning statement required by 21 CFR 101.17(e).
2. Your Parathyroid Dietary Supplement Capsules are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(a)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)] in that the labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Specifically, the product label states that the parathyroid source is porcine, but the BPR for lot(b)(4)shows that the source was(b)(4).
3. Your Enzyme Process brand Multi Life, Alkazyme 3, CoQ10, SuperGest, Uterus Cytotrophin, Lung Cytotrophin, Mammary Cytotrophin, Liver Cytotrophin, Heart Cytotrophin, Orchic Cytotrophin, Thymus Cytotrophin, Thyroid Cytotrophin, Ovary Cytotrophin, Pancreas Cytotrophin, Parathyroid, Pro-T-Complex, and Advanced CardioZyme products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product labels fail to declare all the common or usual names of each ingredient used as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. For example:
a. Your Enzyme Process brand Multi-Life product lists “Citrus Bioflavanoids,” “72 Trace Mineral Blend” and “Phosphatidyl Serine Complex” which appear to be ingredients which themselves contain ingredients (sub-ingredients) but fail to list the sub-ingredients. Further, the label fails to list the capsule ingredients.b. Your Enzyme Process brand Alkazyme 3 product fails to list the capsule or it’s ingredients.c. Your Enzyme Process brand CoQ10 product fails to list the capsule ingredients; furthermore, “pharmaceutical CoQ10” is not the common or usual name of the dietary ingredient.d. Your Enzyme Process brand SuperGest product lists “Gastric Mucosa Substance” which is not the common or usual name. Further, the label fails to list the capsule ingredients.e. Your Enzyme Process brand Uterus Cytotrophin, Lung Cytotrophin, Mammary Cytotrophin, Liver Cytotrophin, Heart Cytotrophin, Orchic Cytotrophin, Thymus Cytotrophin, Thyroid Cytotrophin, and Ovary Cytotrophin products list glandulars and substances for each of the organs listed as USP. However, USP does not have listings for Uterus Cytotrophin,(b)(4), Lung Substance USP,(b)(4), Cytotrophin, Mammary Glandular, Liver Substance, Heart Substance, Orchic Glandular, Thymus Glandular, Thyroid Glandular, and Ovary Glandular. Therefore, these are not the common or usual names for the ingredient.f. Your Enzyme Process brand Pancreas Cytotrophin product lists Pancreas Substance, Porcine as an ingredient. This is not the common or usual name for the ingredient.g. Your Enzyme Process brand Parathyroid product lists Spleen Substance, Biovine [sic] as an ingredient. This is not the common or usual name for an ingredient. Further, the label fails to list the capsule ingredients.h. Your Enzyme Process brand Pro-T-Complex and Advanced CardioZyme products fail to list the capsule ingredients.
4. Your Enzyme Process brand ZymePro, Enzyme Process brand Multi Life, Enzyme Process brand Alkazyme 3, and Enzyme Process brand Pancreas 523 products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labels are incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. For example:
a. The Suggested Use for your Enzyme Process brand ZymePro states to “take 3 tablets twice daily” during inflammation flare-ups but your serving size is listed as “2 tablets.”b. The Suggested Use for your Enzyme Process brand Multi Life states to “take 1-2 capsules 3 times daily” but your serving size is listed as “3 capsules.”c. The Suggested Use for your Enzyme Process brand Alkazyme 3 states “1 to 2 capsules with meals” but your serving size is listed as “1 Capsule.”d. The Suggested Use for your Enzyme Process brand Pancreas 523 states “1 to 2 tablets with each metal [sic]” but your serving size is listed as “1 Tablet.”
5. Your Enzyme Process brand Alkazyme 3 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(6) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(6)] because the label makes structure function claims but fails to bear the required dietary supplement disclaimer in accordance with 21 CFR 101.93(b). Under section 403(r)(6) of the Act, a dietary supplement may bear certain claims, generally called ""structure/function claims,"" on its label or in its labeling provided that the firm has substantiation that the claim is truthful and not misleading; the firm has notified FDA within 30 days of marketing the product bearing the claim; and the claim includes a mandatory disclaimer.
6. Your Enzyme Process brand Pancreas Cytotrophin, ZymePro, Alkazyme 3, CoQ10, B Plus with Glandulars, SuperGest, Pancreas 523, Pancreas Cytotrophin, Liver Cytotrophin, and Omega Complex products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 343 (q)(5)(F)) in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labels of the products do not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. For example:a. Your Enzyme Process brand Pancreas Cytotrophin, ZymePro, Alkazyme 3, CoQ10, B Plus with Glandulars, SuperGest, Pancreas 523, Pancreas Cytotrophin, and Liver Cytotrophin products fail to appropriately position the required heavy bar(s) in the Supplement Facts label, per 21 CFR 101.36(e)(6). Heavy bars are required: beneath the subheading “Servings Per Container” except that if this subheading is not required and as a result not declared, it shall be placed beneath the subheading “Serving Size;” beneath the last dietary ingredient to be listed per 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i); and, beneath the last other dietary ingredient to be listed per 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3).b. Your Enzyme Process brand B Plus with Glandulars product label lists the names of Vit B3 and Vit B5. Your Enzyme Process brand Multi-Life product label lists Betatene®, niacinamide, and Vit D-3 (natural). Each of these dietary ingredients or source of a dietary ingredient is not the common or usual name of the dietary ingredient or a source ingredient, per 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) and (v) and 21 CFR 101.4.c. Your Enzyme Process brand Omega Complex product lists EPA and DHA in the Supplement Facts label. These names are not the common or usual names of the dietary ingredients, per 21 CFR 101.36(b)(3) and 21 CFR 101.4.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.

We also offer the following comments:
Relating to your responsibilities to follow CGMPs for dietary supplements, for the Pro-T Complex, you list(b)(4)assay tests to be performed on the(b)(4)lots and then(b)(4)thereafter. In order for you to conduct(b)(4)lot testing of the finished dietary supplement, you must provide adequate documentation to support your basis for not testing every finished product batch; the quantity of batches and frequency for testing must be supported by a sound statistical sampling plan; and your quality control personnel must review and approve this practice (see 21 CFR 111.75(c)).
Your Enzyme Process brand B-12 Advanced product is labeled as a dietary supplement. However, the suggested use for the product states, “Allow tablets to disolver [sic] under tongue.” Only products that are intended for ingestion may be lawfully marketed as dietary supplements under section 201(ff) of the Act.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation.

Section 743 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 379j-31) authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified noncompliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees [21 U.S.C. 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility.

WARNING LETTER
April 20, 2020
RE: 605222
Dear Mr. Johnson:
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your website at the Internet address https://naturescbdoilnh.business.site/ (directs consumers to https://naturescbdoil.com/) in March 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for various human and animal products, all of which you promote as products containing cannabidiol (CBD). We have also reviewed your social media website at www.facebook.com/naturescbdoil/; this website directs consumers to your website https://naturescbdoil.com to purchase your products. The claims on your website and social media website establish that all strengths and varieties of “Natures Pure CBD Oil,”1various topical CBD products2and CBD edibles3(hereinafter all called “your CBD-containing products for humans”) are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. 355(a) and 331(d). Furthermore, your CBD-containing products for humans are misbranded drugs under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1). In addition, your CBD products for dogs and cats4are unapproved new animal drugs that are unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). FDA has also determined that your “CBD Froggies 25mg,” “CBD Froggies 50mg,” “CBD Edibles 200mg Frogs,” “CBD Edibles 100mg Frogs,” and “CBD Gummies” products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i), because they bear or contain an unsafe food additive. Furthermore, it is a prohibited act to introduce your “CBD Froggies 25mg,” “CBD Froggies 50mg,” “CBD Edibles 200mg Frogs,” “CBD Edibles 100mg Frogs,” and “CBD Gummies” products into interstate commerce under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll).
As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce violates the FD&C Act. You can find the FD&C Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s home page atwww.fda.gov.You can find specific information about how FDA regulates CBD at https://www.fda.gov/news-events/publichealth-focus/fda-regulation-cannabis-and-cannabis-derived-products-includingcannabidiol-cbd.
Dietary Supplement Labeling
Information on your website at https://naturescbdoil.com/ indicates that you intend to market your “Natures CBD 300 mg” (all flavors), “Natures CBD 600 mg” (all flavors) and “Natures CBD 1000 mg” (all flavors) products as dietary supplements. However, your products cannot be dietary supplements because they do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff). FDA has concluded, based on available evidence, that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii). Under those provisions, if an article (such as CBD) is an active ingredient in a drug product that has been approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 355, or has been authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public, then products containing that substance are outside the definition of a dietary supplement.5There is an exception if the substance was “marketed as” a dietary supplement or as a conventional food before the new drug investigations were authorized; however, based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that CBD products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under sections 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) and (ii) of the FD&C Act, but you may present FDA with any evidence that has bearing on this issue.6
Unapproved New Drugs
Based on our review of your websites, your CBD-containing products for humans are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.
Examples of claims observed on your website https://naturescbdoil.com/ that establish the intended use of your products as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your webpage titled “Opioid Addiction: How CBD Oil Can Help”:
• “Natures Pure CBD has had success in alleviating severe withdrawal symptoms associated with opiate dependency. Natures Pure CBD also has taken off the ball and chain around the opiate addicts’ neck and has relieved the addiction totally by using Natures Pure CBD restoring the person back to a quality of life worth living.”
• “The Opiate addiction rate of recovery is low and Natures Pure CBD oil offers promise for those suffering from chronic opiate use.”
• “Natures Pure CBD oil works for these medications which all have addictive properties to them: opium, fentanyl, heroin, hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, morphine and hydromorphone. Natures Pure CBD Oil has been effective in the treatment and eradication of opiate use.”On your webpage titled “CBD Oil Helps with Alcohol and Drug Addiction”:
• “CBD Oil for the treatment of cannabis withdrawal syndrome.”
• “Early Phase in the Development of CBD as a Treatment for Addiction: Opioid Relapse Takes Initial Center Stage”
• “CBD Oil Inhibits the reward-facilitating effect of morphine”
On your webpage titled “CBD Oil Benefits”:
• “CBD Oil for AIDS Virus”• “CBD Oil for Alzheimer’s Disease”• “CBD Oil for Autism”• “CBD Oil for Cancer”• “CBD Oil for Diabetes”• “CBD Oil for Alzheimer’s Disease”• “CBD Oil for Heart Disease”• “CBD Oil for Kidney Disease”• “CBD Oil for Liver Disease”• “CBD Oil for Parkinson’s Disease”• “CBD Oil for Prion/Mad Cow Disease”• “CBD Oil for Stroke and TBI”
On your webpage titled “CBD Oil for Asthma”:
• “Vaping CBD Oil to Treat Asthma . . . Your best best [sic] to combat Asthma is by vaping CBD Oil. When you vape cbd oil, the cbd oil goes directly into your lungs, and you will notice a positive difference in your Asthma usually in day 1. Sometimes it takes people longer up to 2 weeks to feel the difference in their Asthma when vaping cbd oil.”
• “CBD creates a natural calm which would be very useful during an asthma attack.”
On your webpage titled “Nature’s Oil – Types of Products”:
• “Natures Pure CBD is a strong anti-oxidant that can alleviate lower epileptic seizures, psychotic disorders, and has neuroprotective qualities.”
• “CBD can change gene expression and help remove amyloid plaque associated with Alzheimer’s disease.”
• “CBD Oil Tincture with CBD Pain Cream works incredibly fast for people that suffer major health issues such as Inflammation issues, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Back and Joint Pain.”
• CBD Edibles work great also. Real easy and great for on the go.
Your CBD-containing products for humans are not generally recognized as safe and effective for their above referenced uses and, therefore, these products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(p). New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from the FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(d) and 355(a). FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. There are no FDAapproved applications in effect for any of the above-mentioned products.
Misbranded Drugs
Your CBD-containing products for humans are also misbranded within the meaning of section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1), in that their labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. (See 21 CFR 201.5.) The aforementioned products are offered for conditions that are not amenable to self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not medical practitioners; therefore, adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use these drugs safely for their intended purposes. FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your products are not exempt from the requirement that their labeling bear adequate directions for use, under 21 CFR 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, because no FDA approved applications are in effect for them. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
301(ll) and Adulterated Human Foods
Furthermore, it is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), to introduce or deliver for introduction into interstate commerce any food to which has been added a drug approved under section 505 of the FD&C Act or for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and for which the existence of such investigations has been made public. Based on available evidence, FDA has concluded that the prohibition in section 301(ll) applies to CBD. There is an exception if the substance was marketed in food before the drug was approved or before the substantial clinical investigations involving the drug had been instituted. However, based on the available evidence discussed above, FDA has concluded that this is not the case for CBD. FDA is not aware of any evidence that would call into question its current conclusion that section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(ll), prohibits the introduction into interstate commerce of any food to which CBD has been added, but you may present FDA with any evidence bearing on this issue.
According to your product labeling, your “CBD Froggies 25mg,” “CBD Froggies 50mg,” “CBD Edibles 200mg Frogs,” “CBD Edibles 100mg Frogs,” and “CBD Gummies” products are foods to which CBD has been added. Therefore, the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of those products is a prohibited act under section 301(ll) of the FD&C Act.
You should also be aware that, as defined in section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the term ""food additive"" refers to any substance the intended use of which results in its becoming a component of any food, unless the substance is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) among qualified experts under the conditions of its intended use, or unless the substance meets a listed exception.7
Food additives require premarket approval based on data demonstrating safety. Any food additive that has not been approved for its intended use in food is deemed to be unsafe under section 409(a) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 348(a)), and causes the food to be adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)(i). Introduction of an adulterated food into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
There is no food additive regulation which authorizes the use of CBD. We are not aware of any information to indicate that CBD is the subject of a prior sanction (see 21 CFR Part 181). Furthermore, we are not aware of any basis to conclude that CBD is GRAS for use in conventional foods. FDA's regulations in 21 CFR 170.30(a)-(c) describe the criteria for eligibility for classification of a food ingredient as GRAS. The use of a food substance may be GRAS based on either scientific procedures or, for a substance used in food before 1958, through experience based on common use in food (see 21 CFR 170.30).
We know of no basis for general recognition of safety for CBD based either on scientific procedures or common use in food prior to January 1, 1958. Based on our review of published, scientific literature, existing data and information do not provide an adequate basis to conclude that the use of CBD in food meets the criteria for GRAS status. Many unanswered questions and data gaps about CBD toxicity exist, and some of the available data raise serious concerns about potential harm from CBD. Our review of publicly available data associated with the one FDA-approved CBD drug, as well as our review of published scientific literature, identified potential for liver injury from CBD and potentially harmful interactions with certain drugs. In addition, studies in animals have shown that CBD can interfere with the development and function of testes and sperm, decrease testosterone levels, and impair sexual behavior in males. Therefore, based on our review, the use of CBD in your products does not satisfy the criteria for GRAS status under 21 CFR 170.30.
FDA is not aware of any other exception to the food additive definition that would apply to CBD for use as an ingredient in a conventional food. Therefore, CBD added to a conventional food is a food additive under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act and is subject to the provisions of section 409 of the FD&C Act. Under section 409, a food additive is deemed unsafe unless it is approved by FDA for its intended use prior to marketing. CBD is not approved for use in any conventional food. Food containing an unsafe food additive within the meaning of section 409 is adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Therefore, your “CBD Froggies 25mg,” “CBD Froggies 50mg,” “CBD Edibles 200mg Frogs,” “CBD Edibles 100mg Frogs,” and “CBD Gummies” products are adulterated within the meaning of section 402(a)(2)(C)(i) of the FD&C Act. Introduction of these adulterated foods into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
Unapproved New Animal Drugs
During our review of your firm’s website www.naturescbdoil.com, FDA determined that your firm is marketing CBD-containing products for dogs and cats that are unapproved new animal drugs: “Natures Pet CBD,” “CBD Drops Small Dog,” “CBD Drops Large Dog,” “CBD Drops Medium Dog,” and “CBD Drops Cat Formula.” Based on our review of your website, your CBD-containing products for dogs and cats are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(g)(1)(B), because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in animals. Further, as discussed below, these products are unapproved new animal drugs and marketing them violates the FD&C Act.
Examples of claims observed on your website www.naturescbdoil.com that show the intended use of your products for dogs and cats as drugs include, but may not be limited to, the following:
On your webpage titled “CBD Oil For Pets”, along with each of your product pages for your CBD-containing products for animals:
• “Works incredibly well for joint pain for pets.”• “Works especially well for pets that have seizures.”• “Works great for anxiety in pets.”• “Works great for aggression in pets.”
On your webpage titled “Who Can Use CBD Oil”:
• “CBD oil works great for pets that have anxiety issues, hyperactive issues, and ptsd issues.”
On your webpage titled “Natures CBD Oil -Types of CBD Products”:
• “CBD For Petsworks great for older dogs and cats. Perfect for pets that have joint pain, seizures and anxiety issues.”

o “What is CBD oil known to do for pets? Works incredibly well for joint pain for pets. Works especially well for pets that have seizures. Works great for anxiety in pets. Works great for aggression in pets.”
Your CBD-containing products for animals are “new animal drugs” under section 201(v) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 321(v), because they are not generally recognized, among experts qualified by scientific training and experience to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of animal drugs, as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.
To be legally marketed, a new animal drug must have an approved new animal drug application, conditionally approved new animal drug application, or index listing under sections 512, 571, and 572 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b, 360ccc, and 360ccc-l. These products are not approved or index listed by the FDA, and therefore these products are considered unsafe under section 512(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 360b(a), and adulterated under section 501(a)(5) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 351(a)(5). Introduction of these adulterated drugs into interstate commerce is prohibited under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 331(a).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your marketed products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Please notify FDA in writing, within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, of the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.

5CBD is the active ingredient in the approved drug product Epidiolex. Furthermore, the existence of substantial clinical investigations regarding CBD has been made public. For example, two such substantial clinical investigations include GW Pharmaceuticals’ investigations regarding Sativex and Epidiolex. (See Sativex Commences US Phase II/III Clinical Trial in Cancer Pain and GW Pharmaceuticals Receives Investigational New Drug (IND) from FDA for Phase 2/3 Clinical Trial of Epidiolex in the Treatment of Dravet Syndrome). FDA considers a substance to be “authorized for investigation as a new drug” if it is the subject of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) that has gone into effect. Under 21 CFR 312.2, unless a clinical investigation meets the limited criteria in that regulation, an IND is required for all clinical investigations of products that are subject to section 505 of the FD&C Act.
6We also note that the labeling for your “Natures CBD 300 mg” (all flavors), “Natures CBD 600 mg” (all flavors), and “Natures CBD 1000 mg” (all flavors) products states that the products are “designed for dual purpose use, sublingual under the tongue, or for vapes.” The FD&C Act defines the term “dietary supplement” in section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the FD&C Act as a product that is “intended for ingestion.” Because sublingual products are intended to enter the body directly through the skin or mucosal tissues, they are not intended for ingestion. Similarly, because vaping products are intended for inhalation, they are not intended for ingestion. Therefore, your “Natures CBD 300 mg” (all flavors), “Natures CBD 600 mg” (all flavors), and “Natures CBD 1000 mg” (all flavors) products do not meet the definition of a dietary supplement under the FD&C Act for this additional reason.
7Under section 201(s) of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 321(s)), the following types of substances are excluded from the food additive definition: (1) pesticide chemical residues in or on a raw agricultural commodity or processed food, (2) pesticide chemicals, (3) color additives, (4) substances used in accordance with a “prior sanction” (i.e., a sanction or approval granted prior to the enactment of the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 under the FD&C Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, or the Meat Inspection Act), (5) new animal drugs, and (6) dietary ingredients in or intended for use in a dietary supplement.

WL # 589559
March 27, 2020
Dear Mr. Hillman:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, Doctor’s Signature Sales and Marketing International Corp. d/b/a Life Force International, located at 495 Raleigh Ave. El Cajon, CA 92020, on July 9, 11, and 15, 2019. During the inspection, we collected labels for your products. Based on the inspectional findings, a subsequent review of the product labels collected during the inspection, and a subsequent review of your website at the Internet address www.LifeForce.net, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
New and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address www.LifeForce.net in March 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for your products Colloidal Silver and VitalSTART. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:Colloidal Silver
• “Colloidal silver is known as a natural antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral substance.”• “Colloidal silver is also said to be capable of treating fungal infections.”
VitalSTART
• “Maintains Blood Pressure”• “Avoid heart problems and reduce the risk of a stroke.”• “Anti-inflammatory”• “Reduce pain & inflammation.”
Your Colloidal Silver and VitalSTART products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your product VitalSTART is intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Furthermore, your product VitalSTART is intended for prevention of one or more diseases that are not amenable to prevention by consumers themselves without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your product safely for its intended purposes. Accordingly, VitalSTART fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the product is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
In addition, your Colloidal Silver product is labeled as containing colloidal silver as an active ingredient. According to 21 CFR 310.548, any OTC drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)] for which an approved application is required for marketing, without which such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352].
Misbranded Dietary Supplements:
In addition, your FlexeoPlus, BodyBalance with SeaNine, OsteoProCare, and Recharge +Recovery products are misbranded dietary supplements under Section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343]. Our review of the labels for these products collected during this inspection establish that they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR Part 101 as follows:
1. Your FlexeoPlus and OsteoProCare products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(w) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)] in that the finished product labels fail to declare the specific species of shellfish sources as required by section 403(w) of the Act.
Section 201(qq) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(qq), defines a major food allergen as milk, egg, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, and soybeans, as well as any food ingredient that contains protein derived from one of these foods, with certain exceptions, e.g., highly refined oils derived from a major food allergen. A food is misbranded if it is not a raw agricultural commodity and it is, or it contains, an ingredient that bears or contains, a major food allergen, unless either:
The word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, is printed immediately after or is adjacent to the list of ingredients [section 403(w)(1)(A) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(A)]; or
The common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients is followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen) [section 403(w)(1)(B) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(1)(B)].
Specifically, each of your FlexeoPlus and OsteoProCare product labels do not declare the specific type of shellfish present in each product, respectively. A declaration of the “(b)(4)” of fish or Crustacean shellfish for purposes of complying with Section 403(w)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(w)(2)] should be made using the acceptable market name provided in FDA's The Seafood List. We note, however, that if a “Contains” statement is used to declare the source of the fish or Crustacean shellfish, we would not object to just the type of fish or Crustacean shellfish being used, e.g., “Contains salmon” or “Contains trout.”
Furthermore, we note that your FlexeoPlus product label includes the statement “Warning: Contains…an ingredient derived from shellfish. Individuals…who are allergic to shellfish should consult their healthcare professional prior to use.” Your OsteoProCare product label includes the statement “Warning: Individuals allergic to shellfish…should consult their healthcare professional prior to use.” These statements are not the appropriate language to declare a major food allergen as defined by section 201(qq) of the Act (21 U.S.C. § 321 (qq)). Major food allergens should be declared using the word “Contains,” followed by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, printed immediately after or adjacent to the list of ingredients or the common or usual name of the major food allergen in the list of ingredients and followed in parentheses by the name of the food source from which the major food allergen is derived, except that the name of the food source is not required when either the common or usual name of the ingredient uses the name of the food source or the name of the food source appears elsewhere in the ingredient list (unless the name of the food source that appears elsewhere in the ingredient list appears as part of the name of an ingredient that is not a major food allergen).
2. Your Recharge +Recovery product is misbranded within the meaning of 403(a)(1) [21 U.S.C. § 343(a)(1)]. Specifically:
a. The ingredient list on the dietary supplement product does not list an ingredient present in the product, per the batch record ((b)(4)), as required by 21 CFR 101.4(g). The ingredient list is false and misleading in that the product contains(b)(4), but the ingredient is not listed on the label.
b. The label includes the statement “Lemon Balm.” According to the ingredient list, the product contains lemon balm leaf. The label is false and misleading in that lemon balm is the entire plant, but the product contains only the leaf.
3. Your BodyBalance with Sea Nine product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product label bears the claim “phytonutrient-rich blend of aloe vera & nine sea vegetables” but does not meet the requirements of a nutrient content claim using the term “rich”. To bear the claim “rich” source of a nutrient, the product must contain 20% or more of the reference daily intake (RDI) for nutrients under 21 CFR 101.54(b). However, this regulation does not authorize your claim because there is no RDI for phytonutrients.
We note that there are alternative ways to convey the amount of phytonutrients in your products to consumers. For example, the amount of a nutrient in a food may be stated on the product label or labeling in accordance with the requirements in 21 CFR 101.13(i). If you want to seek authorization to use your current claim, you may submit a petition requesting FDA to authorize a new nutrient content claim for phytonutrients (see 21 CFR 101.69). FDA’s review and authorization of a nutrient content claim prior to use in labeling ensures that the claim will provide consistent, meaningful information to consumers about the content of a product.
4. Your FlexeoPlus, BodyBalance with SeaNine, OsteoProCare, and Recharge +Recovery products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
• BodyBalance with SeaNine:a. The Supplement Facts label declares zero amounts of calories from fat, total fat, cholesterol and protein. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared (e.g., amounts corresponding to less than 2 percent of the RDI for vitamins and minerals) in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).b. The phrase “Not a significant source of vitamin A, vitamin C, iron or potassium” should not appear on the Supplement Facts label. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(8)(iii)]• FlexeoPlusa. MSM is not the common or usual name of an ingredient. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(iii) and 101.4(a)(1)]
• OsteoProCarea. The calories per serving fail to be expressed to the nearest 5-calorie increment. [21 CFR 101.9(c)(1) and 101.36(b)(1)]b. The %DV is not rounded to the nearest whole percent for zinc, selenium, chromium, and molybdenum. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C)]
• Recharge +Recoverya. The %DV is not rounded to the nearest whole percent for thiamine, riboflavin, Vitamin C, biotin, folic acid, magnesium, and manganese. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C)]b. The synonym names of Vitamin B1 and Vitamin B2 for thiamin and riboflavin, respectively, when declared in the Supplement Facts label, must be placed in parentheses after the dietary ingredient name. Vitamin B3, B5, B7 and B9 are not permitted as synonym names for niacin, pantothenic acid, biotin, and folic acid, respectively in the Supplement Facts label. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i) and 101.9(c)(8)(v)]c. The (b)(2)-dietary ingredients are in the wrong order. [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B)]d. The Other Ingredients statement must be placed below the Supplement Facts label. [21 CFR 101.36(d) and 101.4(g)]
5. Your BodyBalance with SeaNine product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because it does not include a statement of identity as a “dietary supplement” or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredients that are in the product, as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
6. Your BodyBalance with SeaNine and Recharge +Recovery products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because each label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves, whole or entire plant) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1) and 101.36(d).
7. The OsteoProCare product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(k)] in that the product contains a chemical preservative but the label fails to state that fact. Specifically, the label fails to identify the function of a chemical preservative listed in the ingredient statement ((b)(4)) per 21 CFR 101.22(j).
This letter is not an intended to be an all-inclusive list of violations in connection with your products. It is your responsibility to ensure that your establishment and your products comply with the Act and its implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct all violations noted in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.Additional Comments:
• The ingredient list for your Recharge +Recovery product includes “Bacopa monnieri (Bacopin®).” Bacopin® appears to be a(b)(4)of Bacopa monnieri. We note that the listing of botanicals on the supplement facts panel must specify the part of the plant from which the ingredient is derived. 21 CFR 101.36(d)(1).
• Your Recharge +Recovery product includes the statement “All in a base of elderberry juice.” Your ingredient list shows that the product contains “Natural Elderberry Juice Concentrate.” We note that the statement “juice” without modification implies that your product contains juice that is not made from concentrate.
Please respond in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter. Your response should outline the specific actions you are taking to correct these violations and to prevent similar violations from occurring in the future. You should include in your response documentation and any other useful information that would assist us in evaluating your corrections. If you cannot complete all corrections before you respond, you should explain the reason for your delay and state when you will correct any remaining violations. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.

RE:                 Unapproved and Misbranded Products Related to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

This is to advise you that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed your websites at the Internet addresseswww.immunizationalternatives.com andwww.homeopathicremediesonline.com on March 24, 2020. We also reviewed your social media website at https://www.facebook.com/ImmunizationAlternatives/, where you direct consumers to your website, www.immunizationalternatives.com, to purchase your products. The FDA has observed that your website offers homeopathic drugs and dietary supplement products for sale in the United States and that these products are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19[1]in people. Based on our review, these products are unapproved new drugs sold in violation of section 505(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), 21 U.S.C. § 355(a). Furthermore, these products are misbranded drugs under section 502 of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 352. The introduction or delivery for introduction of these products into interstate commerce is prohibited under sections 301(a) and (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. § 331(a) and (d).
There is currently a global outbreak of respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus that has been named “severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” (SARS-CoV-2). The disease caused by the virus has been named “Coronavirus Disease 2019” (COVID-19). On January 31, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of a public health emergency related to COVID-19 and mobilized the Operating Divisions of HHS.[2]In addition, on March 13, 2020, the President declared a national emergency in response to COVID-19.[3]Therefore, FDA is taking urgent measures to protect consumers from certain products that, without approval or authorization by FDA, claim to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose, or cure COVID-19 in people. As described below, you sell products that are intended to mitigate, prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19 in people. We request that you take immediate action to cease the sale of such unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19.
Some examples of the claims on your website(s) that establish the intended use of your products and misleadingly represent them as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19 include:
Under the webpage “HOMEOPROPHYLAXIS FOR CORONAVIRUS” you provide information about COVID-19 and describe “Homeoprophylaxis For Coronavirus Prevention and Homeopathic Remedies”[from your website https://immunizationalternatives.com/homeoprophylaxis-for-coronavirus/]
You provide a “Recommendation Using Homeopathy to Prevent Coronavirus,” including numerous different products and links to purchase such products[from your website https://immunizationalternatives.com/homeoprophylaxis-for-coronavirus/]

You should take immediate action to correct the violations cited in this letter. This letter is not meant to be an all-inclusive list of violations that exist in connection with your products or operations.  It is your responsibility to ensure that the products you sell are in compliance with the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations. We advise you to review your websites, product labels, and other labeling and promotional materials to ensure that you are not representing your products for a COVID-19 related use for which they have not been approved by FDA and that you do not make claims that misbrand the products in violation of the FD&C Act.Within 48 hours, please send an email toCOVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.govdescribing the specific steps you have taken to correct these violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. Failure to immediately correct the violations cited in this letter may result in legal action, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
FDA is advising consumers not to purchase or use certain products that have not been approved, cleared, or authorized by FDA and that are being misleadingly represented as safe and/or effective for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. Your firm will be added to a published list on FDA’s website of firms and websites that have received warning letters from FDA concerning the sale or distribution of COVID-19 related products in violation of the FD&C Act. This list can be found athttp://www.fda.gov/consumers/health-fraud-scams/fraudulent-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-products.Once you have taken corrective actions to cease the sale of your unapproved and unauthorized products for the mitigation, prevention, treatment, diagnosis, or cure of COVID-19, and such actions have been confirmed by the FDA, the published list will be updated to indicate that your firm has taken appropriate corrective action.
If you cannot complete corrective action within 48 hours, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
If you are not located in the United States, please note that products that appear to be misbranded or unapproved new drugs are subject to detention and refusal of admission if they are offered for importation into the United States. We may advise the appropriate regulatory officials in the country from which you operate that FDA considers your product(s) referenced above to be unapproved and misbranded products that cannot be legally sold to consumers in the United States.
Please direct any inquiries to FDA at COVID-19-Task-Force-CDER@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
CMS 593246Dear Mr. Asprey:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility, Bulletproof 360, Inc., located at 1012 First Avenue, Suite 400, Seattle, Washington, on August 12-15, 20, 22, 28 and September 3 and 6, 2019. The inspection revealed serious violations of FDA's regulation for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
Additionally, FDA reviewed your website, www.bulletproof.com. Based on our review, we have determined that certain of your products are in violation of sections 505(a) and 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a) and 352(f)(1)].
We received your email correspondence dated October 11, 2019, concerning the observations noted on the Form FDA 483, Inspection Observations, that was issued at the close of the inspection. We address your response below, in relation to the adulterated dietary supplement violations.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your website at the Internet address, www.bulletproof.com, in March 2020, and has determined that you take orders there for the products Curcumin Max and Mitosweet. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201 (g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321 (g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links in FDA's home page at www.fda.gov.
Examples of some of the claims on your website that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include:
1. The article titled ""13 ANTI-AGING SUPPLEMENTS TO TURN YOU INTO BENJAMIN BUTTON"" states: ""Curcumin [an ingredient in your Curcumin Max product] ... blocks the production of inflammatory cells and proteins. Here's why that's a big deal: Chronic inflammation puts you at risk of serious conditions like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's ....How to take it: Two softgels daily of Bulletproof Curcumin Max, with food.""
2. The article titled ""D-RIBOSE: THE SWEETENER THAT BOOSTS ENERGY AND WON'T SPIKE YOUR BLOOD SUGAR"" says D-ribose is ""the main ingredient in Bulletproofs natural sweetener, Mitosweet"" and directs consumers to ""Buy Bulletproof Mitosweet now."" The article states, ""D-ribose increases ATP levels in heart cells, giving this muscle the energy it needs to do its job. One study found that D-ribose helped heart failure patients breathe easier, a sign that more blood was getting pumped to the heart. Ribose also lowers LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and oxidized fat - these can build up in your arteries as plaque, blocking the flow of blood to the heart.""
Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are ""new drugs"" under section 201 (p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321 (p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301 (d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331 (d) and 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). ""Adequate directions for use"" means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your Curcumin Max and Mitosweet products are intended for the treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, these products fail to bear adequate directions for its intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301 (a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 331 (a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Your Chocolate Collagen Protein and Vanilla Collagen Protein products are adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP regulations for dietary supplements.
We understand that your firm establishes the component and product specifications for your dietary supplement products. We also understand that you are responsible for verifying that your finished packaged dietary supplements meet product specifications, and that you instruct a co-manufacturer to release your finished packaged dietary supplements into distribution.
During the inspection, FDA investigators observed the following significant violations of the CGMP regulations for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to establish component specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b), for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement. Specifically, you must establish an identity specification for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). The document you purport to use as your specifications for your bovine hydrolyzed collagen protein (a component used in your Chocolate Collagen Protein and Vanilla Collagen Protein products) lists characteristics for identity that are not sufficient to determine the identity of this component, as these characteristics also describe hydrolyzed collagen protein derived from other animal sources.
We have reviewed your response dated October 11, 2019, which states that you have established an identity specification for each component that you use in the manufacture of your dietary supplements. However, we cannot evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions, because you did not provide component specifications along with your response.
2. You failed to establish product specifications for each dietary supplement that you manufacture for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you have not established product specifications for the composition of your Chocolate Collagen Protein and Vanilla Collagen Protein products.
Once you have established the specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70, you must take specific actions to determine whether the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73 and 21 CFR 111.75. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95.
We have reviewed your October 11, 2019, response, but we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions, as you did not provide product specifications along with your response.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility or in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA's costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses incurred in connection with FDA's arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31 (a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021, to the attention of Tracy K. Li, Compliance Officer. If you have any questions concerning this letter, you can contact Ms. Li at(425) 302-0428.

WARNING LETTER 586299
Dear Mr. Warner:
On May 20-23, 2019, investigators with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 7365 Highway 127 South, Crossville, Tennessee. Based on the inspectional findings, a subsequent review of your product labeling, including your “Medicinal Catalog,” collected during the inspection and your website at www.warnerherbs.com, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s website at www.fda.gov.
Unapproved New Drugs/Misbranded Drugs
FDA reviewed your “Medicinal Catalog” and website at the Internet address www.warnerherbs.com in January 2020 and has determined that you take orders there for the products AZ, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, P, P-SITES, TC, AL, AS, BRONC, CHO, ENDO, F, HY, PL, and PN. The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21United States Code(UCS) § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.

PL• “PLEURISY”
PN• “PNEUMONIA”Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 USC § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 USC §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating the drug is safe and effective.
A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 USC § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.
Your products AZ, C, DB, G-K-S, HB, TC, BRONC, CHO, ENDO, and PN are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self-diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your AZ, C, DB, G-K-S, HB, TC, BRONC, CHO, ENDO, and PN products fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 USC § 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act [21 USC § 331(a)].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
During the May 20-23, 2019 inspection of your facility, our investigators observed the following significant violations of FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for dietary supplements, Title 21,Code of Federal Regulations(CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR 111). These violations render your dietary supplement products adulterated under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 (USC) § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. Additionally, even if your AZ, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, P, P-SITES, TC, AL, AS, BRONC, CHO, ENDO, F, HY, PL, and PN products did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs and misbranded drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act because the products have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet the CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. We address your response below in relation to each of the relevant violations.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You did not perform manufacturing operations under conditions and controls that protect against the potential for contamination, as required by 21 CFR 111.365(a). For example, during the inspection our investigator observed:
a. On May 21, 2019, an employee bottling your B-CL dietary supplement (bottle Lot(b)(4)) in the(b)(4)Area traveled to the(b)(4)Area to(b)(4). The bottling employee(b)(4). The bottling employee then filled additional capsules with your B-CL dietary supplement (from bulk powder Lot(b)(4)) before leaving the(b)(4)Area and returning to the(b)(4)Area.
b. On May 21, 2019, an employee bottled your Saw Palmetto (bottle Lot(b)(4)), GKS (bottle Lot(b)(4)), and B-CL lot (bottle Lot(b)(4)) dietary supplements in the(b)(4)Area. The employee did not perform cleaning operations of the(b)(4)between these product runs.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. Your response indicates that employees were informed of certain actions to avoid contamination. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because your response does not provide documentation to demonstrate that you are performing manufacturing operations under conditions and controls that protect against the potential for contamination.
2. You did not establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). Specifically, you indicated that you have not established finished product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition, and for limits on contamination that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of dietary supplement. Additionally, our investigator observed that you have not established finished product specifications for your dietary supplement products including, but not limited to, B-CL, Gingko Leaf, P-SITES, PRO, and GKS, that you manufactured, packaged, labeled, and/or distributed.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. Your response indicates that employees were instructed “(b)(4)” and to take certain actions to reduce the possibility of cross contamination. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because your response does not address or demonstrate that you have established product specifications for the finished batch of dietary supplements you manufacture, as noted above.
3. You did not establish specifications for the packaging and labeling of the finished packaged and labeled dietary supplement, including specifications to ensure that you used the specified packaging and that you applied the specified label, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(g). Specifically, you have not established packing and labeling specifications for your finished dietary supplement products, including, but not limited to, your Saw Palmetto, GKS, and B-CL products.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. Your response indicates that you are implementing a label inventory log and providing “(b)(4)” as corrective actions. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because your response does not address or demonstrate that you have established specifications for the packaging and labeling of the finished dietary supplements you manufacture, as noted above.
4. You did not establish component specifications for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b). Specifically, you failed to establish the following component specifications:
a. Identity specification [21 CFR 111.70(b)(1)];b. Component specifications, for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met [21 CFR 111.70(b)(2)]; andc. Specifications that establish the limits on those types of contamination that may adulterate or may lead to adulteration of the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement [21 CFR 111.70(b)(3)].
Before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must also confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2).
5. You did not establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103 and 21 CFR 111.140(b)(1). Specifically, our investigator observed that you do not have written procedures for responsibilities of the quality control operations, and you do not perform or document any of the required quality control operations for the processes you perform, such as material review and disposition decisions.Once you have established your quality control written procedures, you must implement quality control operations in your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.65, and you must implement a system of production and process controls that covers all stages of manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in a master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.55. Quality control personnel must ensure that your manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.105. Furthermore, you must have documentation, at the time of performance, of the quality control personnel review and approval for release, or rejection, of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.127(h) and 111.140(b)(2).
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you indicate that you are in the process of developing such written procedures. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide documentation to demonstrate that you have established such written procedures.
6. You did not prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). Specifically, your employee indicated that the firm does not have master manufacturing records for any of your dietary supplements.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you indicate that you are in the process of developing master manufacturing records. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any documentation demonstrating that you have established such records.
7. You did not prepare a batch production record every time you manufactured a batch of dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(a). Specifically, your employee indicated that the firm does not have batch production records for any of your dietary supplements.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you state that you are in the process of developing a “batch product log.” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any documentation demonstrating that you are preparing batch production records every time you manufacture a batch.
8. You did not establish written procedures for your packaging and labeling operations, as required by 21 CFR 111.403. Specifically, you do not have written procedures for your packaging and labeling operations. Such procedures must satisfy the requirements that apply to packaging and labels as specified in 21 CFR 111.410, including controlling the issuance and use of packaging and labels and reconciliation of any issuance and use discrepancies [21 CFR 111.410(b)]. We note that our investigator observed that you did not conduct label reconciliation of any issuance and use discrepancies for labels issued and used during labeling operations on May 21, 2019 for GKS (bottle Lot(b)(4)), and B-CL (bottle Lot(b)(4)).
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you state that “(b)(4)” and will be maintaining a log of outgoing and incoming labels “(b)(4).” However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any documentation demonstrating that you have established such written procedures.
9. You did not collect and hold reserve samples of each lot of packaged and labeled dietary supplements that you distribute, as required by 21 CFR 111.83(a). Specifically, you did not collect and hold reserve samples for the finished dietary supplement products that you distribute.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you state that you are now maintaining reserve samples. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any documentation demonstrating that you are collecting and holding reserve samples.
10. You did not identify each unique lot within each unique shipment of components that you receive and any lot of components that you produce in a manner that allows you to trace the lot to the supplier, the date received, the name of the component, the status of the component (e.g., quarantined, approved, or rejected); and to the dietary supplement that you manufactured and distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.155(d)(1). Specifically, you do not identify each unique lot within each unique shipment in a manner that allows you to trace the components you receive and/or produce. For example, during the inspection our investigator observed that:
a. approximately 28 of(b)(4)entries reviewed from your Receiving Log notepad for components received at your firm did not identify the supplier.b. none of the approximately(b)(4)entries reviewed from your Receiving Log notepad for components received at your firm contained the date the components were received at your firm.c. none of the approximately(b)(4)entries reviewed from your Receiving Log notepad for components received at your firm contained the status of the components (e.g., approved, quarantined, or rejected).d. numerous different components received at your firm were noted to have been assigned the same internal lot number of the approximately(b)(4)entries reviewed from your Receiving Log notepad for components received at your firm.
We acknowledge receipt of your undated written response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you on May 23, 2019. In your response, you state that you are in the process of developing a receiving log. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your response because you did not provide any documentation demonstrating that you are identifying each unique lot in a manner that allows you to trace the components you receive and produce to the distributed dietary supplement.
11. You did not identify each unique lot within each unique shipment of packaging in a manner that allows you to trace the lot to the supplier, the date received, the name of the packaging, the status of the packaging (e.g., quarantined, approved, or rejected); and to the dietary supplement that you distributed, as required by 21 CFR 111.160(d)(1). Specifically, during the inspection our investigator observed that you do not identify or log any unique lot of packaging materials (e.g., bottles and caps) received at your firm and used in the packaging of your finished dietary supplements.

Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Certain of your dietary supplement products, as discussed below, are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 USC § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101. Additionally, even if your AZ, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, P, P-SITES, and TC products are dietary supplements and/or were not unapproved new drugs/misbranded drugs, they would be misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act and/or in violation of the following provisions of 21 CFR 101.
1. Your Warner’s brand AZ, BL-C, BOW-C, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, K, L, NA, P, PRO, P-SITES, TC, TEST-B, and Turmeric Root products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 USC § 343 (q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling of your product does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. Specifically:
a. The standardized common name of a botanical dietary ingredient as noted in Herbs of Commerce must be used in the Supplement Facts label, per 21 CFR 101.36(d) and 101.4(h). If no standardized common name exists, then the Latin binomial name must be indicated. For example, on your AZ product, you list Echinacea Angustifolia. This is the Latin binomial name. However, the Herbs of Commerce lists three common or usual names. One of these names should be listed rather than the Latin binomial name.b. The term “star grub” in the Warner’s brand DB product does not appear to be a standardized common name.c. These product labels fail to present nutrition information on the nutrition label using the title supplement facts in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(e).d. These product labels fail to enclose the supplement facts information in a box separate from other labeling material with the headings, hairlines, bolding, etc. as required by 21 CFR 101.36(e).
2. Your Warner’s brand TC and NA products are misbranded within the meaning of sections 403(s)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 USC §§ 343 (s)(2)(A)(ii)(I) and 343(q)(5)(F)] in that their labels fail to include the quantitative amount by weight per serving size of all the dietary ingredients as required by 21 CFR 101.36.
3. Your Warner’s brand BL-C, BOW-C, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, K, L, P, PRO, P-SITES, TEST-B, and Turmeric Root products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 USC § 343(i)(2)] in that it is fabricated from two or more ingredients, and each ingredient is not declared on the label by the common or usual name, in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4 and 21 CFR 101.36. Specifically, the ingredient list does not declare the capsule ingredient as an “other ingredient,” in accordance with 21 CFR 101.4(g). Further, the declaration of “gelatin capsules” does not include the ingredients comprising the capsules.
4. Your Warner’s brand BL-C, BOW-C, C, DB, Devil’s Claw Root, Ginkgo Leaf, G-K-S, HB, K, L, NA, P, PRO, P-SITES, TC, TEST-B, and Turmeric Root products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(B) of the Act [21 USC § 343(q)(1)(B)] because the labels fail to list the servings per container under the serving size on the left hand side of the nutrition label or fails to include this information as part of the net quantity of contents declaration in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(1)(ii).
5. Your Warner’s brand BOW-C product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 USC § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. Your Serving Size is listed as “2 capsules” and your Directions state to “Take 2-4 capsules in the morning, 2-4 capsules at night.” Therefore, the correct serving size should be 4 capsules.
6. Your Warner’s brand L, NA, P-SITES, B-CL, BOW-C, G-K-S, K, P, PRO, C, HB, and DB products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 USC § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the labels fail to identify, in English, the part of the plant (e.g. root, leaves, entire or whole plant) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1). Likewise, “herb” does not identify the specific part of the plant.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations.

Section 743 of the Act, 21 USC § 379j-31, authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including reinspection-related costs. A reinspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Reinspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the reinspection and assessing and collecting the reinspection fees, 21 USC § 379j-31(a)(2)(B). For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for reinspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any reinspection-related costs.
Please send your reply to correspondence to the ORAHAFEAST5FirmResponses@fda.hhs.gov mailbox. Any questions you may have regarding this process should be directed to Compliance Officer Zada L. Giles at (615) 366-7985.

WARNING LETTER
WL 594867Dear Mr. Costilla:
The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspected your facility located at 1420 Decision St., Ste. C, Vista, CA on August 12-13, 15, and 19, 2019. The inspection revealed serious violations of the FDA’s regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause the dietary supplement products manufactured at your facility to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA’s home page at http://www.fda.gov.
We have received your written response dated August 28, 2019, concerning the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on August 19, 2019. We address your response below in regard to the specific violations, which are as follows:
1. You failed to establish specifications required by 21 CFR 111.70. Specifically:
a. You failed to establish component specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b), for each component that you use in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, including for components of the Male Formula Blend, Energy Veg (also known as Extreme Energy), and Total Cleanse dietary supplements you manufacture. In particular, you did not establish an identity specification for each component used in the manufacture of a dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(1). You also did not establish component specifications that are necessary to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the dietary supplements manufactured using the components are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(b)(2).
Before using a component, you must conduct at least one appropriate test or examination to verify the identity of any component that is a dietary ingredient, as required by 21 CFR 11.75(a)(1)(i), unless you petition the agency under 21 CFR 111.75(a)(1)(ii) and the agency exempts you from such testing. You must confirm the identity of other components and determine whether other applicable component specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(b) are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(a)(2). You must also ensure that the tests and examinations that you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of the specifications established, as required by 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
b. You failed to establish specifications for dietary supplement labels and for packaging that may come in contact with dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). For example, during the inspection you stated that you have not established label and packaging specifications for the(b)(4)products you manufacture.
c. You failed to establish product specifications for the identity, purity, strength, and composition of the finished batch of the dietary supplement, and for limits on those types of contaminants that may adulterate, or that may lead to adulteration of, the finished batch of the dietary supplement to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(e). For example, during the inspection, our investigator observed that you did not have finished product specifications for the Male Formula Blend product that you manufacture.
Once you have established specifications, you must determine whether the specifications are met in accordance with 21 CFR 111.73, and you must make and keep records in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95(b).
We have reviewed your August 28, 2019 response, in which you stated(b)(4)component and finished product specifications for all dietary supplements that you manufacture. You also provided documents that you purport to be component and finished product specifications for your CHI‐206 product. However, these documents do not demonstrate that you have established finished product specifications for the purity and strength of the finished batch of the CHI-206 dietary supplement, or that you have established component specifications to ensure that specifications for the purity, strength, and composition of the finished CHI-206 product are met. Further, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy your corrective actions to address the noted violations because you did not provide specifications for any other dietary supplement you manufacture—including your Male Formula Blend, Energy Veg (aka Extreme Energy), Total Cleanse, Estro Strike 2.0, and Solluna (Detoxy) products.
2. You failed to prepare and follow a written master manufacturing record (MMR) for each unique formulation of dietary supplement that you manufacture, and for each batch size, to ensure uniformity in the finished batch from batch to batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.205(a). For example, during the inspection you did not have a written MMR for the Male Formula Blend or the Glucosamine with Chondroitin and MSM dietary supplements manufactured by your firm.
In addition, the written MMRs you were able to provide to our investigator failed to include information required by 21 CFR 111.210. Specifically, the MMRs you provided to our investigator for your Extreme Energy (aka Energy Veg) and Total Cleanse did not include the following:
a) A statement of theoretical yield of a manufactured dietary supplement expected at each point, step, or stage of the manufacturing process where control is needed to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement, and the expected yield when you finish manufacturing the dietary supplement, including the maximum and minimum percentages of theoretical yield beyond which a deviation investigation of a batch is necessary and material review is conducted and disposition decision is made, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(f);b) A description of packaging and, with respect to the Total Cleanse, a representative label, or a cross-reference to the physical location of the actual or representative label, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(g); andc) Written instructions, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h), including the following:i. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(2); andii. Corrective action plans to use when a specification is not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5).
We have reviewed your response dated August 28, 2019, in which you (1) stated(b)(4)an MMR for each product you manufacture; and (2) included what you purport to be a written MMR for your CHI-206 product. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions to address the noted violations because you did not include MMRs for the Male Formula Blend, Glucosamine with Chondroitin and MSM, Energy Veg (aka Extreme Energy), or Total Cleanse products. Moreover, the documents you provided for your CHI-206 product do not include all the information required under 21 CFR 111.210.
3. Your batch production records (BPRs) did not include complete information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.255(b) and 21 CFR 111.260. For example, during the inspection our investigator collected copies of your batch production records for the Energy Veg (aka Extreme Energy) and Solluna (Detoxy) dietary supplements that you manufacture, which did not include the following:
a) The identity of equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(b);b) The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross-reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(c);c) The unique identifier that you assigned to each capsule, packaging material, and label used, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(d).d) A statement of the actual yield and a statement of the percentage of theoretical yield at appropriate phases of processing, such as after blending and after encapsulation, as required by 21 CFR 111.260 (f);e) Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with § 111.70(e) and (g), as required by 21 CFR 111.260(i); andf) Documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control personnel (1) reviewed the BPR; and (2) approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(l).
We have reviewed your response dated August 28, 2019, in which you (1) stated(b)(4)all your BPRs to include all the information required by 21 CFR 111.260; and (2) provided a copy of documents you purport to be the BPR for your CHI-206 product. However, the documents you provided do not include all of the information required by 21 CFR 111.260.
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist at your facility. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.
Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations.

If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection related costs.

WARNING LETTER
February 21, 2020Dear Mr. Bhairi:
This letter concerns products that your firm distributes to consumers via your website, www.naturalrx.net. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has obtained a sample and labeling of the product, “Silver Bullet”. As described below, this product is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) [21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a) and 331(d)]. Furthermore, the product is a misbranded drug under section 502 of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352] and sold in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 331(a)].
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that a sample of your “Silver Bullet” contains the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredient sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Sildenafil is the active ingredient in the FDA-approved prescription drug Viagra used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs, such as nitroglycerin, and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Men with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease, often take nitrates.
You market “Silver Bullet” as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)], a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act, unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Viagra (containing sildenafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on March 27, 1998. Given that sildenafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Viagra was approved, “Silver Bullet,” which contains sildenafil, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act.
Unapproved New Drug
“Silver Bullet” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)] because it is intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body. Label statements documenting the intended uses of “Silver Bullet” include, but are not limited to, the following:
“GET BIGGER & HARDER”
“WORKS IN MINUTES…LASTS FOR DAYS”
Your “Silver Bullet” is also a new drug under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)], because it is not generally recognized as safe and effective under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Under sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)], a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless an FDA-approved application is in effect for it. Your marketing and distribution of “Silver Bullet” without an approved application violates these provisions of the FD&C Act.
Misbranded Drug
Your “Silver Bullet” also is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)], in that the labeling for this drug fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended [21 CFR § 201.5]. All PDE-5 inhibitors, which have been approved for marketing by FDA, are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. Prescription drugs can be used safely only at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write “adequate directions for use” for prescription drugs. “Silver Bullet” is not exempt from the requirements that its labeling bear adequate directions for use by a layperson [21 U.S.C. §§ 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115], because there is no FDA approved application in effect for this product. For these reasons, “Silver Bullet” is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act.
Additionally, under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(a)], a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(n)], provides that, in determining whether an article's labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account…not only representations made or suggested…but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations.” The labeling for “Silver Bullet” does not declare that it contains sildenafil. The failure to disclose the presence of sildenafil in the product’s labeling renders “Silver Bullet” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act. The presence of undeclared PDE-5 inhibitors contained in your product may pose serious health risks, because consumers with underlying medical issues may take this product without knowing that it can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. For example, PDE-5 inhibitors may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs (such as nitroglycerin) and can lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. Consumers with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates. Those consumers who have been advised against taking PDE-5 inhibitors because of comorbidities or potential drug interactions, may seek products like “Silver Bullet” because it is marketed as a dietary supplement.
The undeclared sildenafil in “Silver Bullet” also cause this product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)], in that the product’s labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use “Silver Bullet” would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared drug ingredients and placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §331(a)].
The issues and violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law and FDA regulations, and to ensure that all products you manufacture or distribute are in compliance with the FD&C Act and all of its implementing regulations and all other requirements of federal law. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to implement lasting corrective action of violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure, injunction, and/or prosecution.
You should notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) working days from your receipt of this letter of the current status of your corrective actions and the specific steps you have taken to correct the noted violations. In your response, please include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete all corrections before you respond, you should explain the reason for the delay and include a timetable for the implementation of any remaining corrections.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Ashley:
The United States (U.S.) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your facility located at 1302 Pleasant Ridge Rd., Greensboro, North Carolina, from May 21, 2019, through May 28, 2019. Among other operations, your firm distributes dietary supplement products that are contract manufactured for you under your firm’s name. The inspection found serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You may find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA’s homepage atwww.fda.gov.
Failure to Submit a Serious Adverse Event Report
You failed to submit a Serious Adverse Event Report (SAER) as required by section 761(c) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379aa-1(c)]. Specifically, you received reports of the following serious adverse events but did not submit an SAER as required:
• Complaint dated 3/15/2018 - TLS Nutrition Shake. Complainant reported prolonged hospitalization due to becoming winded, vertigo symptoms, and inability to walk after using the product, for which complaint asserted six weeks of physical therapy were needed to regain the ability to walk.
• Complaint dated 1/28/2019 - TLS 21-Day Challenge Kit (TLS Nutrition Shakes, Isotonix OPC-3, NutriClean 7-DayCleansing System, TLS Core dietary supplement products). Complainant reported inpatient hospitalization was needed due to various adverse reactions including abdominal pain, constipation, vomiting, dizziness, itching of skin, weakness, shaking, insomnia, chills, headache, tingling and numbness, and cramps after a week of using the products.
Under section 761(c) of the Act, you must submit a report of a serious adverse event associated with any of your dietary supplements no later fifteen (15) business days after a report of the event is received through the address or phone number provided on your dietary supplement products.Because prompt submission of such serious adverse event reports is important for public health reasons, the agency recommends that all serious adverse events be reported to FDA within fifteen (15) business days of receipt regardless of the means by which you receive the initial report. These serious adverse event reports should be submitted under the MedWatch Form 3500A. More information on adverse event reporting can be found on FDA’s website atwww.fda.gov, in the publication “Questions and Answers Regarding Adverse Event Reporting and Recordkeeping for Dietary Supplements as required by the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection.”
We acknowledge receipt of your written response dated July 11, 2019, to the observations reported to you on the Form FDA-483, Inspectional Observations, which was issued to you on May 28, 2019. With respect to the observations relating to serious adverse event reporting, you provided revised procedures for assessing the severity level of an adverse event and determining whether such event is reportable. While the revised procedures provide adequate details for assessing the severity of adverse events, your response does not address whether a retrospective review of all adverse events will be conducted to determine if a serious adverse event report should be submitted to FDA.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your Isotonix OPC-3, Heart Health Essential Omega III, Isotonix Multivitamin, Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron, Isotonix OPC-3, and Isotonix Activated B-Complex products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements as required by 21 CFR 101, as follows:
1. Your Isotonix OPC-3 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the label is incorrect. Serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and 21 CFR 101.12(b) Table 2. The directions of use suggest the consumer take 2 capfuls per 150 lbs of body weight for the first 7-10 days and take 1 capful thereafter, but the serving size lists 1 capful (3.3 g). The serving size listed should be 2 capfuls which is the maximum amount recommended.
2. Your Heart Health Essential Omega III, Isotonix Multivitamin, Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron, and Isotonix Activated B-Complex products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
• The Heart Health Essential Omega III and Isotonix Activated B-Complex product labels list (b)(2)-dietary ingredients in amounts that are zero or that can be declared as zero. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredients not present, or in amounts that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c), shall not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). Specifically:o The Heart Health Essential Omega III label declares saturated fat, trans fat, total carbohydrates, and sugars as zero.o The Isotonix Activated B-Complex label declares calcium as “5 mg” (1 %DV); less than 2% DV is an amount that can be declared as zero in 101.9(c).
• The Isotonix Activated B-Complex label declares “thiamin HCL (vitamin B1),” “riboflavin-5-phosphate (vitamin B2),” and “niacinamide (vitamin B-3)”; the Isotonix Multivitamin and Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron labels declare “beta-carotene (vitamin A precursor).” The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words ""as"" or ""from"", in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d). The quantitative amounts by weight shall represent the weight of the dietary ingredient rather than the weight of the source of the dietary ingredient [21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(A)]. “Vitamin B-3” is not a synonym specified for niacin in 21 CFR 101.9 or 101.36(b)(2)(i)(B).
3. Your Isotonix OPC-3 product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
The violations cited in this letter are not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of the violations identified above and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to correct these violations may result in legal action without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and/or injunction.
We also offer the following comments:
1. Your Isotonix Multivitamin and Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron product labels declare the quantitative amount of copper as 100 mcg whereas the correct unit of measurement is mg in accordance with 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) and 101.36(b)(2)(ii)(B).
2. Your Isotonix Multivitamin and Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron product labels declare the ingredient “lo han” whereas the standardized common name listed in the reference Herbs of Commerce is “luo han guo.”3. Your Isotonix OPC-3, Isotonix Multivitamin, and Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron product labels each include intervening material within the Supplement Facts label. The Isotonix OPC-3 label’s statement about Pycnogenol, the Isotonix Multivitamin label’s statement about Quatrefolic®, and the Isotonix Multivitamin with Iron label’s statements about Quatrefolic® and SunActive® Fe are not permitted within the Supplement Facts label. All information appearing on the information panel of the product label must appear in one place without other intervening material [21 CFR 101.2(e)].
Within fifteen (15) working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the specific steps you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations, as well as copies of related documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction. If you do not believe that your products are in violation of the FD&C Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Your written response should be sent to Patricia F. Hudson, Compliance Officer, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 60 8th Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309. If you have any questions regarding the content of this letter, please contact Patricia F. Hudson at 404-253-2221 or email at patricia.hudson@fda.hhs.gov.

WARNING LETTER
Dear Mr. Smyth:
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at(b)(6), on August 5, 2019, through August 15, 2019. Based on the inspection, we have identified serious violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements regulation, Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
In addition, FDA reviewed your labels and labeling, including monthly newsletters that you provide with customer orders, your product catalog, and your website, www.rgarden.com, where you take orders for your products. Based on our review, the claims on your website and promotional materials for your products including, but not limited to, Vitamin O, Gamma-Zyme, L. Salivarius, Vitamin B-12, Colloidal Silver, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Cordyceps, Cordyceps Plus, Amylase Formula, Lipase Formula, Maximizer, and Quadra-Zyme Plus products establish that they are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
We have also reviewed the product labels for your Vitamin O, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Maximizer, Multi-Vitamin Plus, Resveratrol Complex, CoQ-10 Formula, Gamma-Zyme, and Colloidal Silver products. Based on our review, we have concluded these products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343].
You may find the Act and related regulations through links in FDA’s home page at www.fda.gov.
We received letters from you dated August 21, 2019, and October 14, 2019, written in response to the Form FDA 483, Inspectional Observations, issued to you at the close of the inspection. We address your responses below, in relation to the adulterated dietary supplements violations.
Unapproved New Drugs and Misbranded Drugs
During the inspection, our investigator collected labeling for your dietary supplements, including your product catalog, R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health, and your monthly newsletters, which are included with your customer orders. In addition, we have reviewed your website, www.rgarden.com in October 2019, and again in February 2020, and have determined you take orders there for your products, including Vitamin O, Gamma-Zyme, L. Salivarius, Vitamin B-12, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Cordyceps, Cordyceps Plus, Amylase Formula, Lipase Formula, Maximizer, and Quadra-Zyme Plus. The claims on your labeling, including your website, product catalog, and newsletters, establish that these products are drugs under section 201(g)(1)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act.
Examples of claims on your website www.rgarden.com and promotional materials that provide evidence these products are intended for use as drugs include, but are not limited to:

Gamma-Zyme
• From the web page “Gamma-Zyme” on your website www.rgarden.com: “[ingredient in the product] Ferulic acid appears to provide health benefits due to its ability to prevent abnormal tissue growth”.
• R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health product catalog: “Gamma-Zyme is a soothing alternative for those suffering from ulcers, gastritis, severe burning sensations, irritable bowel syndrome, or intestinal lining damage.”

• R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health product catalog: “Reduces the risk of age-related brain and heart diseases, including Alzheimer’s.”

Colloidal Silver
• R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health product catalog: “[Colloidal Silver] may be taken orally or applied topically to cuts, scrapes, open sores, sunburned skin . . .”
Your July 2019, R-Garden Newsletter labeling also contains evidence of intended use in the form of personal testimonials recommending or describing the use of your Vitamin O product for the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Examples of such testimonials include:
• “Three years ago they said that I’m starting to get cataracts, so l put a drop of Vitamin O in each eye at bedtime. Now two weeks ago when I got my eyes checked they said nothing about cataracts.""
• ""I like your Vitamin O. I've had a headache where painkillers didn't seem to help much. I rubbed Vitamin O in and it did wonders. l also like to use it for colds. Baby had a cold so we took him to the doctor. His oxygen was reading in the upper 70's and into 80's so they sent us on to Urgent Care. On the way up I gave him some of your Vitamin O. When we got there and checked his oxygen it was 98.”
• “The Vitamin O stopped my husband’s sleep apnea.”
In addition, your Vitamin O, Gamma-Zyme, L. Salivarius, Vitamin B-12, Colloidal Silver, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Cordyceps, Cordyceps Plus, Amylase Formula, Lipase Formula, Maximizer, and Quadra-Zyme Plus products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above referenced uses and, therefore, the products are “new drugs” under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)]. New drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d), 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective.
Further, a drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). “Adequate directions for use” mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner.Your Vitamin O, Vitamin B-12, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Cordyceps, Cordyceps Plus, Gamma-Zyme, Amylase Formula, Lipase Formula, Maximizer, and Quadra-Zyme Plus are intended for the treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to selfdiagnosisor treatment without supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use these products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, these products failed to bear adequate directions for their intended uses and, therefore, these products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)].
Furthermore, according to 21 CFR 310.548, any over-the-counter drug product containing colloidal silver ingredients that is labeled, represented, or promoted for the treatment and/or prevention of any disease is regarded as a “new drug” within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(p)] for which an approved application is required for marketing, without which such product is also misbranded under section 502 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 352].
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
Even if your products listed above did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs, these products would be adulterated dietary supplements under section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] because they have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements:
1. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103. Specifically, during the inspection it was observed that you lack written procedures for quality control operations, including for documentation of how you qualify your(b)(4)manufacturers, approve formulations and labels, and release product for distribution.
You failed to have quality control operations to approve for release, or reject, any packaged and labeled dietary supplements (including a repackaged or relabeled dietary supplement) for distribution, as required by 21 CFR 111.127(h). Once quality control procedures are established, you must make and keep records, as required by 21 CFR 111.140(b).
We acknowledge your written responses dated August 21, 2019, and October 14, 2019. In your first response, you state that you will complete written procedures for quality control operations for your firm and that you will provide them to us in three weeks. Your second written response includes your(b)(4)manufacturer’s written procedures for quality control operations for the(b)(4)they manufacture for you. However, you only provided a copy of your(b)(4)manufacturer’s quality control check for(b)(4)and not a copy of your own firm’s written procedures for quality control.
2. You failed to establish specifications for dietary supplement labels (label specifications), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). During the inspection you stated that although you design the labels, have them printed, approve them after printing, and send the finished and approved dietary supplement labels to your(b)(4)manufacturer, you do not have label specifications for your dietary supplement products, including your Vitamin O product.
We acknowledge your written response dated August 21, 2019, which states that you will create label specifications within eight weeks. However, we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of the corrections because the label specifications have not yet been provided.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Even if your products listed above did not have therapeutic claims that make them unapproved new drugs, your products would be misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] based on the following violations:
1. Your Vitamin O, Protease Plus, Sun Energy, Maximizer, Multi-Vitamin Plus, Resveratrol Complex, CoQ-10 Formula, Gamma-Zyme, Colloidal Silver, L. Salivarius, Vitamin C Complex, and Vitamin D-3 products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labels does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.9. Specifically:
a. The Vitamin O, Multi-Vitamin Plus, and Protease Plus product labels declare (b)(2)-dietary ingredients as zero or in amounts that are <2% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI) for the nutrient on the Supplement Facts label. Any (b)(2)-dietary ingredient that is not present or that is present in amounts that can be declared as zero in 21 CFR 101.9(c) must not be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). Specifically:
i. The Vitamin O label lists calories and carbohydrate as zero. Further, the label lists “Trace amounts of: Chloride, Sodium, Calcium, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Copper, and Selenium.” We have not defined “trace amounts.” If these (b)(2) nutrients are present in amounts that can be declared as zero, they must not be declared in the Supplement Facts label. If they are present in amounts greater than can be declared as zero, then they must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i).ii. Likewise, your Protease Plus product label declares “calcium citrate” by weight and as <1% of the Daily Value (DV). Calcium is a (b)(2) dietary ingredient and must be listed as the amount by weight of the calcium nutrient, not the weight of the source of the nutrient.However, it must not be listed within the Supplement Facts label if it is present in an amount that can be declared as zero.
iii. The Multi-Vitamin Plus label declares iodine at 1% DV. It must not be listed within the Supplement Facts label if it is present in an amount that can be declared as zero.
b. Your L. Salivarius, Protease Plus, Maximizer, Resveratrol Complex, CoQ-10 Formula, and Gamma-Zyme product labels list incorrect serving sizes. The serving size for a dietary supplement is the maximum amount consumed per eating occasion as recommended on the product label as defined in 21 CFR 101.9(b) and Table 2 in 21 CFR 101.12(b). However:
i. The L. Salivarius label’s Directions state to take “one or more capsules.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists one capsule as the serving size. In addition, we note that the L. Salivarius product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take up to three capsules at a time.
ii. The Protease Plus label’s Directions state to take “one or more capsules.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists one capsule as the serving size. In addition, we note that the Protease Plus product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take up to four capsules at a time.
iii. The Maximizer (90, 180, and 360 capsules count) label’s Directions state to take “two or more capsules.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists two capsules as the serving size. In addition, we note that the Maximizer product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take up to four capsules at a time.
iv. The Resveratrol Complex label’s Directions state to take “one or more capsules with meals, or as desired.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists one capsule as the serving size. In addition, we note that the Resveratrol Complex product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take one or more capsules with meals, or as desired.
v. The CoQ-10 Formula label’s Directions state to take “one or more capsules with meals.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists one capsule as the serving size. In addition, we note that the CoQ-10 Formula product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take one or more capsules with meals.
vi. The Gamma-Zyme (100 and 200 capsules count) label’s Directions state to take “one or more capsules.” However, the Supplement Facts label lists one capsule as the serving size. In addition, we note that the Gamma-Zyme product web page on your website www.rgarden.com lists directions to take up to four capsules at a time.
c. The Colloidal Silver product label fails to list the serving size for each of the age groups indicated on the label which includes 1 teaspoon (5 mL) once a day for adults, and for children to take ¼ - ½ teaspoon (1.25 - 2.5 mL) once a day. The product is for persons within two different groups, and the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(E).
d. Your R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health product catalog bears the nutrient content claim for your Sun Energy product “[ingredients in the product] Wheatgrass sprouts and Barley Grass [are] Naturally rich in a range of important vitamins, minerals, amino acids, phytonutrients and metabolic enzymes.” Vitamins or minerals listed in 21 CFR 101.9(c)(8)(iv) or (c)(9) must be declared if added for purposes of supplementation, or when a claim is made about them in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(i). However, the Sun Energy Supplement Facts label fails to list any vitamins or minerals.
Further, in order to bear the nutrient content claim, the amounts of nutrients in the product must be sufficient to qualify as a “rich” source of the nutrients, as defined in 21 CFR 101.54(b).
e. Your Multi-Vitamin Plus label declares Vitamin B3 and Vitamin B5, each of which is not the common or usual name for a (b)(2)-dietary ingredient per 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9(c)(8)(iv)-(v)).
f. Your Vitamin C Complex label appears to be using the DVs and RDIs that existed prior to July 2016; this is permitted until dietary supplement product labels must be compliant with the Nutrition Facts and Supplement Facts label final rule. However, the label fails to declare the correct % DV for potassium and zinc in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(iii)(C).g. Your Vitamin D-3 label fails to correctly declare the amount of Vitamin D-3. The amount of Vitamin D may, but is not required to, be expressed in international units (IU), in addition to the mandatory declaration in mcg. Any declaration of the amount of Vitamin D in IU must appear in parentheses after the declaration of the amount of Vitamin D in mcg in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36 and 101.9(c)(8)(iv).
h. The Resveratrol Complex product label bears the statement, “Resvinol is a registered trademark of Ethical Naturals, Inc.” within the Supplement Facts label. This statement is not permitted to be in the Supplement Facts label. 21 CFR 101.36(b). The light bar above this statement is also not permitted.
i. The Vitamin C Complex product’s (b)(2)-dietary ingredients are not listed in the correct order in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2)(B). The source for each of the dietary ingredients calcium, magnesium, potassium, and zinc is not declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(d). The source ingredient that supplies a dietary ingredient may be identified within the nutrition label in parentheses immediately following or indented beneath the name of a dietary ingredient and preceded by the words “as” or “from” that is listed on the Supplement Facts label or be listed in the ingredient list.
2. Your Sun Energy product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(r)(1)(A)] because the product labeling bears unauthorized nutrient content claims. Under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act, a claim that characterizes the level of a nutrient which is of the type required to be in the labeling of food must be made in accordance with a regulation authorizing the use of such a claim. Characterizing the level of a nutrient in the food labeling of a product without complying with the specific requirements pertaining to nutrient content claims for that nutrient misbrands the product under section 403(r)(1)(A) of the Act.
Specifically, your July 2019, R-Garden Newsletter, which you include with your customer orders, bears the statement, “Sun Energy contains four superfoods high in chlorophyll and rich in many essential nutrients: Chlorella, Spirulina, Wheat Grass and Barley Grass.”
Additionally, your R-Garden Products for Your Path to Health product catalog bears the nutrient content claim, “[ingredients in the product] Wheatgrass sprouts and Barley Grass [are] Naturally rich in a range of important vitamins, minerals, amino acids, phytonutrients and metabolic enzymes.”“High” and “rich” claims may only be made for nutrients that have an RDI. An RDI has not been established for chlorophyll, amino acids, phytonutrients and metabolic enzymes per 21 CFR 101.13(b) and 21 CFR 101.54(b).
3. Your Herbal Blends Prostate System, Herbal Blends Pancreas System Blend, Herbal Blends Liver Gallbladder System, Gamma-Zyme, EpiCor Formula, Cordyceps Plus, Cordyceps, CoQ-10 Formula, Bowel Toner, Amylase Formula, Advanced Joint Formula, Vitamin D-3, Vitamin C Complex, Sun Energy, Resveratrol Complex, Quadra-Zyme Plus, Protease Plus, Pine Bark Extract, Milk Thistle Formula, Resveratrol Complex, and Memory Formula products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that each product label fails to declare the common or usual name of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4.
For example, your Memory Formula, Lion’s Mane is not the standardized common name of a botanical. For your Resveratrol Complex, red wine fruit extract fails to identify the “fruit”. For your Herbal Blends Pancreas System Blend, Triphala is not a standard common name. Several products indicate “rice complex” in the other ingredients list (Herbal Blends Prostate System, Herbal Blends Pancreas System Blend, Herbal Blends Liver Gallbladder System, Gamma-Zyme, EpiCor Formula, Cordyceps Plus, Cordyceps, CoQ-10 Formula, Bowel Toner, Amylase Formula, Advanced Joint Formula, Vitamin D-3, Vitamin C Complex, Sun Energy, Resveratrol Complex, Quadra-Zyme Plus, Protease Plus, Pine Bark Extract, Milk Thistle Formula, Memory Formula); this is not the common or usual name of an ingredient.
4. Your Memory Formula, Herbal Blends Eyes System, Herbal Blends Liver Gallbladder System, Milk Thistle Formula, and Herbal Blends Prostate System products are each misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] because the label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1).
For example, for your Memory Formula, Lion’s Mane is missing the plant part. For your Herbal Blends Eyes System, “aerials” are not a specific plant part. For your Herbal Blends Liver Gallbladder System, Horsetail has no plant part and Cleavers “herb” is not a plant part. For your Herbal Blends Pancreas System Blend, the plant part is missing for Horsetail and Broccoli. For your Herbal Blends Prostate System, Horsetail, Basil, and Pygeum africanum are each missing the plant part.
5. The Colloidal Silver products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(e)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(e)(2)] because the label fails to correctly declare the net quantity of contents on the principal display panel, as required by 21 CFR 101.7. Specifically, the product label fails to list the net quantity of contents in fluid measure in terms of fluid ounce in accordance with 21 CFR 101.7(b)(2). The net quantity of contents must be expressed in both fluid ounce and metric equivalent as required by the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act [15 U.S.C. § 1453(a)(2)].
This letter is not an all-inclusive list of violations at your facility. It is your responsibility to ensure that your products comply with the Act and FDA’s implementing regulations. You should take prompt action to correct the violations cited in this letter. Failure to promptly correct the violations specified above may result in legal action without further notice, including seizure of violative products and/or injunction.
In addition to the violations described above, we offer the following comment:
Your Vitamin O and Colloidal Silver products, although labeled as dietary supplements, are also intended for use as topical sprays on the skin or for other topical uses as described in your product catalog and in the customer testimonials in your July 2019, R-GardenNewsletter. Under section 201(ff)(2)(A)(i) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(2)(A)(i)], the term “dietary supplement” is defined as, among other things, a product “intended for ingestion.” Products that are intended to be used topically or introduced into the body other than through ingestion are not dietary supplements because they are not “intended for ingestion.”
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA’s costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA’s arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31(a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.
Please notify this office in writing within fifteen (15) business days from your receipt of this letter of the specific steps you have taken to correct the violations noted above and to ensure that similar violations do not occur. Your response should include any documentation necessary to show that correction has been achieved. If you cannot complete all corrections before you respond, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will complete the corrections. If you believe that your products are not in violation of the Act, include your reasoning and any supporting information for our consideration.
Please send your reply to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021, to the attention of Tracy K. Li, Compliance Officer.  If you have any questions concerning this letter, you can contact Ms. Li at (425) 302-0428.

WARNING LETTER
In reply, refer to: CMS 585324Dear Ms. Marx:The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted an inspection of your facility, located at 851 NW Highland Street, Roseburg, Oregon, on May 14, 2019, through May 22, 2019. Based on the inspectional findings, we have identified serious violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) and applicable regulations. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on the FDA's home page athttp://www.fda.gov.
Adulterated Dietary Supplements
The inspection of your facility revealed serious violations of FDA's regulations for Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) in Manufacturing, Packaging, Labeling, or Holding Operations for Dietary Supplements, under Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Part 111 (21 CFR Part 111). These violations cause your dietary supplement products, including your Absinthium Herbal Liquid Extract 100 ml (Absinthium), S21 Multi Somaplex 100 ml (Multi Somaplex), S9 Molybdenum Somaplex 30 ml (Molybdenum), and your S17 Manganese-Copper-Cobalt Somaplex 30 ml (Manganese-Copper-Cobalt) products, to be adulterated within the meaning of section 402(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 342(g)(1)] in that the dietary supplements have been prepared, packed, or held under conditions that do not meet CGMP requirements for dietary supplements.
The significant violations documented during the inspection include, but are not limited to, the following:
1. You failed to establish the required specifications for any point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(a). Specifically, you failed to establish:
a. Specifications to provide sufficient assurance that the product you received for packaging and labeling as a dietary supplement (and for distribution rather than return to the supplier) is adequately identified and is consistent with the purchase order, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(f). For example, you failed to establish specifications to ensure that the bulk shipments of Multi Somaplex received for repackaging and labeling, and for distribution rather than return to the supplier, is adequately identified and consistent with the purchase order.
b. Specifications for the packaging and labeling of the finished packaged and labeled dietary supplements, including specifications that ensure that you used the specified packaging and that you applied the specified label, as required by 21 CFR 111.70(g), for the liquid dietary supplement products that you repackage, label, and distribute.
c. Specifications for dietary supplement labels (label specifications) and for packaging that may come in contact with dietary supplements (packaging specifications), as required by 21 CFR 111.70(d). For example, you have not established packaging and labeling specifications for your Multi Somaplex dietary supplement product.
Once you have established the specifications, as required by 21 CFR 111.70, you must take specific actions to determine whether the specifications are met, as required by 21 CFR 111.73. You must also ensure any tests and examinations you use to determine whether the specifications are met are appropriate, scientifically valid methods, as required by 21 CFR 111.75(h)(1), and you must make and keep records of all activities relating to such specifications, in accordance with 21 CFR 111.95(b)(1).
We have reviewed your June 14, 2019, August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, responses. Your June 14, 2019, response included a document titled ""Product Specification Sheet"" that purportedly provided specifications for only one product, a N11/AB Liquid 20 ml product. However, this document does not adequately address the requirements for identity, purity, strength, and composition specifications for this product. Moreover, your response did not include specifications for any of the other dietary supplements that your firm sells. You indicate that you have ""begun building SPECS for all of our products"" and that you expect to complete this process ""no later than 8/31/19."" However, you have failed to provide us documentation demonstrating that this process was completed. You did not provide any additional specifications in your August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, correspondence and therefore your responses are inadequate.
2. You failed to establish and follow written procedures for the responsibilities of the quality control operations, including written procedures for conducting a material review and making a disposition decision, and for approving or rejecting any reprocessing, as required by 21 CFR 111.103.
To the extent that you contract with other firms to manufacture your product that your firm releases for distribution under your firm's name, your firm has an obligation to know what and how manufacturing activities are performed so that you can make decisions related to whether your dietary supplement products conform to established specifications and whether to approve and release the products for distribution [see 72 Fed. Reg. 34752, 34790 (Jun. 25, 2007)). Although a firm may contract out certain dietary supplement manufacturing operations, it cannot contract out its ultimate responsibility to ensure that the dietary supplement it places into commerce (or causes to be placed into commerce) is not adulterated for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements (see United States v. Dotterweich, 320 U.S. 277, 284 (1943) (explaining that an offense can be committed under the Act by anyone who has ""a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws""); United States v. Park, 421 U.S. 658, 672 (1975) (holding that criminal liability under the Act does not turn on awareness of wrongdoing, and that ""agents. vested with the responsibility, and power commensurate with that responsibility, to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act"" can be held accountable for violations of the Act)). In particular, the Act prohibits a person from introducing or delivering for introduction, or causing the delivery or introduction, into interstate commerce a dietary supplement that is adulterated under section 402(g) for failure to comply with dietary supplement CGMP requirements [see 21 U.S.C. §§ 342(g) and 331 (a)]. Thus, a firm that contracts out some or all of its operations must establish a system of production and process controls to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.55). The quality control personnel must ensure that the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record (21 CFR 111.105). Further you must have documentation of the quality control personnel review and approval for release of any packaged and labeled dietary supplement (21 CFR 111.127(h) and 21 CFR 111.140(b)(2)).
We have reviewed your June 14, 2019, August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, responses, but we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. Your June 14, 2019, response states a quality control procedure was being created but this procedure was not included in this or the August 8, 2019, or October 31, 2019, response.
3. Your Master Manufacturing Records (MMRs) for your dietary supplement products that you package and label failed to include the information required by 21 CFR 111.210. For example, the MMRs for your Molybdenum, Manganese-Copper-Cobalt, and Multi Somaplex products you provided to our investigator failed to include the following information:
a. Written instructions, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h), including the following:
i. Specifications for each point, step, or stage in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(1).
ii. Procedures for sampling and a cross-reference to procedures for tests or examinations, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(2).
iii. Specific actions necessary to perform and verify points, steps, or stages in the manufacturing process where control is necessary to ensure the quality of the dietary supplement and that the dietary supplement is packaged and labeled as specified in the master manufacturing record, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(3).
iv. Special notations and precautions to be followed, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(4).
v. Corrective action plans for use when a specification is not met, as required by 21 CFR 111.210(h)(5).
We have reviewed your June 14, 2019, August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, responses. The MMRs provided in your June 14, 2019, response continued to be deficient in the areas cited above. Although you state in your June 14, 2019, response that you have updated all of your MMRs, those MMRs still do not contain the information, as required above by 21 CFR 111.210. Those MMRs now contain representative labels but still do not contain the necessary information listed above. Additionally, you did not provide any further responses to this issue in your August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, correspondence and these responses do not address this issue. Therefore, your responses are inadequate.
4. Your batch production records (BPRs) failed to include the required information relating to the production and control of each batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.260. Specifically, your BPR for Multi Somaplex, Lot 136172 did not include the following information:
a. The date and time of the maintenance, cleaning, and sanitizing of the equipment and processing lines used in producing the batch, or a cross reference to records, such as individual equipment logs, where this information is retained, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(c).
b. Documentation that the finished dietary supplement meets specifications established in accordance with 21 CFR 111.70(e) and (g), as required by 21 CFR 111.260(i).
c. Documentation, at the time of performance, that quality control personnel:
i. Reviewed the batch production record, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(I)(1).
ii. Approved and released, or rejected, the batch for distribution, including any reprocessed batch, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(1)(3).
iii. Approved and released, or rejected, the packaged and labeled dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.260(1)(4).
You did not provide any completed BPRs or documentation of any corrective actions you have taken to address this issue in your June 14, 2019, August 8, 2019, or October 31, 2019, correspondence and therefore your responses are inadequate.
5. You failed to calibrate instruments and controls you use in manufacturing or testing a component or dietary supplement, as required by 21 CFR 111.27(b). Specifically, our investigator observed your(b)(4)model scale contained a calibration sticker stating the last calibration date was July 23, 2012, that expired on July 23, 2013, and you could not provide evidence this scale has been recalibrated since this date.
We have reviewed your June 14, 2019, August 8, 2019, and October 31, 2019, responses, but we are unable to evaluate the adequacy of your corrective actions. Your June 14, 2019, response states you have contacted a calibration company and included an invoice from this company but documentation was not provided to show your equipment was calibrated. You did not provide any further response or describe any corrective actions you have taken to address this issue in your August 8, 2019, or October 31, 2019, correspondence and therefore your responses are inadequate.
Misbranded Dietary Supplements
Your Para A Herbal Liquid Extract 59 mL (Para A), Absinthium Herbal Liquid Extract 100 mL (Absinthium), and S21 Multi Somaplex 100 ml (Multi Somaplex) products are misbranded dietary supplements under section 403 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343] because they do not comply with the labeling requirements for dietary supplements, as required by 21 CFR 101, as follows:
1. Your Para A product is misbranded within the meaning of section 403(i)(2) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(i)(2)] in that the product label fails to declare the common or usual names of each ingredient used, as required by 21 CFR 101.36 and 21 CFR 101.4. Specifically, your Para A label declares the dietary ingredient ""Citrus seed extract"" but this is not the common or usual name of a dietary ingredient.
2. Your Para A, Absinthium, and Multi Somaplex products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(5)(F) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(q)(5)(F)] in that the presentation of the nutrition information on the labeling does not comply with 21 CFR 101.36. For example:
a. Your Para A, Absinthium and Multi Somaplex products' Supplement Facts label fails to list the serving size for each of the age groups indicated on the label which include suggested use by both adults and children. If the product is represented for persons within more than one group, the quantitative amount and percent of Daily Value for each group shall be presented in separate columns in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b )(2)(iii)(E).
b. Your Multi Somaplex product label lists (b)(2)-dietary ingredients as components of the Proprietary Ionic Trace Element Blend whereas (b)(2)dietary ingredients must be declared in accordance with 21 CFR 101.36(b)(2).
3. Your Para A product is misbranded within the meaning of 403(s)(2)(B) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(B)] because it does not include a statement of identity as a ""dietary supplement"", as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g). The word ""dietary"" may be deleted and replaced by the name of the dietary ingredients in the product or an appropriately descriptive term indicating the type of dietary ingredients that are in the product. Your Para A label includes a statement of identity as ""Herbal Liquid Extract."" While this is an appropriately descriptive term of the dietary ingredients, it fails to include the term ""supplement"", as required by 21 CFR 101.3(g).
4. Your Para A and Absinthium products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(s)(2)(C) of the Act [U.S.C. § 343(s)(2)(C)] in that each label fails to identify the part of the plant (e.g., root, leaves) from which each botanical dietary ingredient in the product is derived, as required by 21 CFR 101.4(h)(1) and 101.36(d)(1). For example, your Para A and Absinthium product labels fail to declare the specific part of certain plants that use the term ""aerial part"" or ""aerial portion"".

If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the time within which you will complete the correction.
Section 743 of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31] authorizes FDA to assess and collect fees to cover FDA's costs for certain activities, including re-inspection-related costs. A re-inspection is one or more inspections conducted subsequent to an inspection that identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act, specifically to determine whether compliance has been achieved. Re-inspection-related costs means all expenses, including administrative expenses, incurred in connection with FDA's arranging, conducting, and evaluating the results of the re-inspection and assessing and collecting the re-inspection fees [21 U.S.C. § 379j-31 (a)(2)(B)]. For a domestic facility, FDA will assess and collect fees for re-inspection-related costs from the responsible party for the domestic facility. The inspection noted in this letter identified non-compliance materially related to a food safety requirement of the Act. Accordingly, FDA may assess fees to cover any re-inspection-related costs.Your written reply should be sent to the Food and Drug Administration, 22215 26th Avenue SE, Suite 210, Bothell, Washington, 98021, to the attention of Tracy K. Li, Compliance Officer. If you have any questions, please contact Compliance Officer Li at (425) 302-0428.

WARNING LETTERCMS #590422
January 13, 2020Mr. Rivera,
This letter is to advise you that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed the information on your website, https://www.liprodietpill.com, and Facebook pages, https://www.facebook.com/Lipro-Diet-Pills-191157693096 and https://www.facebook.com/LiproDietPills, and determined that you market and offer a product for sale in violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). More specifically, FDA has determined that the “Lipro Dietary Capsule” product you offer for sale is an unapproved new drug sold in violation of sections 505(a) and 301(d) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 355(a) and 331(d)]. Furthermore, this product is a misbranded drug sold in violation of sections 502 and 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 352 and 331(a)].
FDA confirmed through laboratory analysis that your “Lipro Dietary Capsule” contains undeclared tadalafil, which is a phosphodiesterase type-5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. Tadalafil is the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Cialis, used to treat erectile dysfunction (ED). This undeclared ingredient may interact with nitrates found in some prescription drugs such as nitroglycerin and may lower blood pressure to dangerous levels. People with diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease often take nitrates.
FDA has issued awarning to consumersnot to use “Lipro Dietary Capsule” (see Lipro Dietary Capsule Immediate Public Notification).
Although you engaged in communication with the Agency regarding a recall of “Lipro Dietary Capsule” on(b)(4), to date your firm has not voluntarily recalled the product. We continue to recommend that the product be recalled from the market.You market “Lipro Dietary Capsule” as a dietary supplement. However, under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)], a dietary supplement may not include an article that is approved as a new drug under section 505 of the FD&C Act unless that article was marketed as a dietary supplement or food before its approval as a drug. FDA approved Cialis (containing tadalafil as the active ingredient) as a new drug on November 21, 2003. Given that tadalafil was not marketed as a dietary supplement or as a food before Cialis was approved, “Lipro Dietary Capsule,” which contains tadalafil, is excluded from the definition of a dietary supplement under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(i) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(ff)(3)(B)(i)].
Unapproved New Drug
“Lipro Dietary Capsule” is a drug as defined by section 201(g)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)] because it is intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease conditions and/or affect the structure or function of the body.

In addition, your “Lipro Dietary Capsule,” is a new drug under section 201(p) of the FD&C Act 21 U.S.C. 321(p), because this product is not generally recognized as safe and effective under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling. Under sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a)], a new drug may not be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce unless an FDA-approved application is in effect for it. There are no approved applications on file with FDA for your “Lipro Dietary Capsule.” Your marketing and distribution or sale of “Lipro Dietary Capsule” in interstate commerce without an approved application violates these provisions of the FD&C Act.
Misbranded Drug
Your “Lipro Dietary Capsule” product is also misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1)] in that the labeling for this drug fails to bear adequate directions for use. “Adequate directions for use” means directions under which a layman can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended. [See 21 CFR § 201.5]. All PDE-5 inhibitors which have been approved for marketing by FDA are limited by an approved new drug application to use under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs. “Lipro Dietary Capsule” is a prescription drug as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 353(b)(1)(A)] because, in light of its toxicity or potentiality for harmful effect, the method of its use, or the collateral measures necessary for its use, it is not safe for use except under the supervision of a practitioner licensed by law to administer such drugs; therefore adequate directions for use cannot be written so that a layperson can use your product safely. Under 21 CFR §§ 201.100(c)(2) and 201.115, FDA-approved prescription drugs that bear their FDA-approved labeling are exempt from the requirements that they bear adequate directions for use by a layperson. However, your “Lipro Dietary Capsule” is not exempt from the requirement that its labeling bear adequate directions for use because no FDA-approved application is in effect for this product.
Additionally, under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(a)], a drug is misbranded if its labeling is false or misleading in any particular. Section 201(n) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(n)] provides that, in determining whether an article’s labeling or advertising “is misleading there shall be taken into account . . . not only representations made or suggested . . . but also the extent to which the labeling or advertising fails to reveal facts material in light of such representations . . ..” The labeling for “Lipro Dietary Capsule” does not declare that it contains tadalafil. The failure to disclose the presence of tadalafil in the product’s labeling renders “Lipro Dietary Capsule” misbranded under section 502(a) of the FD&C Act. As discussed earlier, the presence of an undeclared PDE-5 inhibitor contained in your product may pose serious health risks because consumers with underlying medical issues may take this product without knowing that it can cause serious harm or interact in dangerous ways with other drugs they may be taking. Those consumers who have been advised against taking PDE-5 inhibitors because of comorbidities or potential drug interactions may seek products like “Lipro Dietary Capsule” because it is marketed as a dietary supplement.
The undeclared tadalafil in “Lipro Dietary Capsule” also causes this product to be misbranded under section 502(f)(2) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2)], in that the product's labeling lacks adequate warnings for the protection of users. As previously noted, there is potential for adverse events associated with the use of PDE-5 inhibitors. Consumers who use “Lipro Dietary Capsule” would be unaware of the presence of the undeclared ingredient and unknowingly placed at risk for their associated adverse events.
The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of this misbranded drug product is a prohibited act under section 301(a) of the FD&C Act [21 U.S.C. §331(a)].
